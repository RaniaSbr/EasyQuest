    "title": "Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and\n  LHC energies",
    "abstract": "  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is\npresented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n"

Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have\nreceived increased attention in recent years.

The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees\nwith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the\nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil\nevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests\nthat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the\nEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from\nEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1).

The Cooper pair\nwave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by\nthe correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and\nannihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a\nthree-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are\nexamined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order\n(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the\nside with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by\nODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found\nthat at $(k_F a)^{-1}, \\ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more\nthan 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.\n"

In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric\nsector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore\ndifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and\nthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive\nthe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory\nand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the\nsecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse\nprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back\nthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of\ninterest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple\ncosmological model.\n"

Numerical methods were devised to calculate\nresponse to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing\nprevious solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were\nfound to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high\naccuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for\ncomposite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock\ninteractions with a planar interface between different materials. These\ncalculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics\nexperiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example\ncalculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects\nof plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and\nshock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.\n"

In particular we present a set\nof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the\nextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of\nresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with\nthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling\nof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches\nbetween several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO\npopulation and our Spitzer data set.\n"

    "abstract": "  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\naccretion curtain model.\n"

    "title": "Stochastic Lie group integrators",
    "abstract": "  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential\nequations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth\nfinite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport\nalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie\ngroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding\nLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group\nintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary\ndifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are\nuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.\nLastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid\nbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by\ntwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.\n"

    "abstract": "  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,\nremains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.\nHere we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter\nwavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\nperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that\nprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features\nwithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of\nthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.\n"

In the linear regime it was found that\nthe confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the\nlateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic\nmagnetization takes place at the edges.\n  In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a\nwaveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction\nwith the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The\nexperiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the\nshape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the\nconfinement.\n"

We find that the $\\bar\\nu_e$\nspectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant\nconversion.

We prove that errors in any measured quantity are\nbounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when\nthe latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is\nsignificantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.\nTherefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller\nthan for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term\ndecreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough\nscatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical\nsimulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number\nof new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.\n"

    "abstract": "  It is outlined the possibility to extend the quantum formalism in relation to\nthe requirements of the general systems theory. It can be done by using a\nquantum semantics arising from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. It\nis so possible taking into account the logical openness relationship between\nobserver and system. We are going to show how considering the truth-values of\nquantum propositions within the context of the fuzzy sets is here more useful\nfor systemics . In conclusion we propose an example of formal quantum\ncoherence.\n"

    "abstract": "  We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice\nBoltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without\nblurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the\nsame work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes\nand finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction\nof nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar\nquantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)\nbased on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy \"trimming\") and (ii)\nbased on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical\nproperties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy\nproduction and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are\npossible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:\n1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven\ncavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.\nAll limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic\nquasiequilibria.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical\nplasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).\nThe key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the\nmean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron\nfrequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail.\n"

    "abstract": "  This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear\nperiodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a\nvariable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging\nmethod, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable\nequations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\nwaves in slowly varying media.\n"

The location\naccuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by\nthe conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the\nintelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is\navoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft\nframe structures by the acoustic emission method.\n"

We introduce and investigate globally (or\nintrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most\ncommonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,\nLandesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible,\nsemi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*},$-Finsler, $C^{h},$-recurrent,\n$C^{v},$-recurrent, $C^{0},$-recurrent, $S^{v},$-recurrent, $S^{v},$-recurrent of\nthe second order, $C_{2},$-like, $S_{3},$-like, $S_{4},$-like, $P_{2},$-like,\n$R_{3},$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant\ncurvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global\ndefinitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various\nrelationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler\nmanifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved\nglobally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting\nidentities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the\ncurvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely\nglobal, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local\ncounterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special\nFinsler spaces considered.\n"

The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well\naccounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from\npure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite\ninterlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive\ninteractions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals\ndensity functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The\nuse of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal\nparameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and\npotassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding\nseparation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are\nreported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are\nreported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal\napproach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.\n"

    "abstract": "  We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing\nbinary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf\nsecondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \\pm 0.000010$ days, with\nan orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \\pm 0.021$. We demonstrate\ngenerally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined\nbinary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the\nlight curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique\nline in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we\nassume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation\nhas been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line\nbroadening, $V_{\\rm rot}, \\sin i_{\\rm rot}, = 28.9 \\pm 1.0$ \\kms, gives a primary\nradius of $R_{\\rm A}, = 1.28 \\pm 0.04$ \\rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to\nthe radius of the secondary, $R_{\\rm B}, = 0.167 \\pm 0.006$ \\rsun, and the\nsemimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \\pm 0.30 \\rsun = 0.0351 \\pm 0.0014$ AU.\nOur single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the\nindividual masses, $M_{\\rm B}, = 0.124 \\pm 0.010$ \\msun and $M_{\\rm A}, = 1.04\n\\pm 0.13$ \\msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical\nmass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from\ndouble-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity\nto study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.\n"

    "abstract": "  Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objects\nassociated with sections of star bodies and invoking\n  Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourier\nanalysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized\ncosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application to\ninvestigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call\n$\\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the\nsense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of\n$L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional\nsubspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine\ntransforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to\nthe study of sections of $\\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of\nthis class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review some\nknown facts and give them new proofs.\n"

Our analysis on\ntwo-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode\nsequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\\Theta(m\\log n)$,\nwithout a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm.\nClassical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for\nanalysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and\nfor continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance\nof the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both\nsimulated and real DNA sequences.\n"

    "abstract": "  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory\nof free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical\nview-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg\nequations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for\nuniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some\nclass of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their\ngeneralizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity\nof all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg\nequations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is\nsolved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal\nordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies\ncorresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction\nof the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation\nrelations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables\nis reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed\nthe requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum\nmean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the\nonly known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not\ncontradict to the existing data.\n"

    "abstract": "  Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for\nnanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,\nphotodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are\nimportant to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two\ntypes of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also\nhave strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is\nundertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation\nbased on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation\nfunctions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and\ncorresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale\nrandom fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two\ndots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the\ncorrelation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical\nfilm height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and\nSAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with\ncorresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature\na stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical\nanalysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.\n"

    "abstract": "  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not\nnecessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a\nresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms\nof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite\ndimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant\nsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological\nclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given\ntype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes\nand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a\nplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is\nimportant. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth\nrate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives\nsufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any\nother such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical\nsubsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give\nconditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf\ncontaining it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf\ncohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified\nwith the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the\nsmooth and holomorphic setting.\n"

We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2},. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2}, or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4}, -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF\nimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values\n(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not\ndepend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the\nglobular cluster system.\n"

    "title": "Matter-Wave Bright Solitons with a Finite Background in Spinor\n  Bose-Einstein Condensates",
    "abstract": "  We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite\nbackground in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an\nintegrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o},dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply the\ninverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The\nresulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under\nvanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit\nmanner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into\ntwo kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies\nthe ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the\npolar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton\ncollisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a\ncollision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the\nprevious studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and\ndark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of\nthe multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.\n"

    "abstract": "  The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggested\ndensity matrix of the Universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemble\nin quantum cosmology. This ensemble corresponds to a uniform (weight one)\ndistribution in phase space of true physical variables, but in terms of the\nobservable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddle-points of the\n{\\em Lorentzian}, path integral. They are represented by the recently obtained\ncosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological\nconstant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages\nof expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within\nthe concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the\nbounded range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemble\nsuggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and,\nsimultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy problem in the form of\nthe quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the Universe.\n"

    "abstract": "  We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of\nclustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2},$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1},$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions\nshow that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,\nindependently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.\n"

    "title": "A Universality in PP-Waves",
    "abstract": "  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in\nspace-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the\nspace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field\nconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the\npp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the\nbackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses\ncan be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.\n"

It is expressed by\nexperimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively\nby the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical\nlaw, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental\ndata by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the\nkernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The\nproposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy\nchaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict\na future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor\nerror is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is\nexpressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are\nused in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the\npredictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.\n"

At the order $\\cal{O},(\\alpha_s^2)$,\ntwist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit\nthe Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon\nbremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon\nscattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark\n(antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the\nratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is\nnot negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The\nmodifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark\nannihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark)\ndistribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark\ndistributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and\nantiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively\nexplains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron\nsuppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark\nannihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the\nlarge fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet\nquenching in heavy-ion collisions.\n"

Despite progress in assembly and oriented synthesis, pristine\nSWNTs in aligned and close-packed form remain elusive and needed for high\ncurrent, speed and density devices through collective operations of parallel\nSWNTs. Here, we develop a Langmuir Blodgett method achieving monolayers of\naligned SWNTs with dense packing, central to which is a non covalent polymer\nfunctionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs in\nan organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB film\ncompression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment and\npacking of SWNTs characterized by microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy.\nThe monolayer SWNTs are readily patterned for device integration by\nmicrofabrication, enabling the highest currents 3mA through the narrowest\nregions packed with aligned SWNTs thus far.\n"

We find that both singlet and triplet modes of high density condense\nat the transition, signaling restoration of lattice symmetry. In our approach,\nwhich goes beyond mean-field theory in terms of the triplet excitations, the\ntransition appears sharp; however since our method breaks down near the\ncritical point, we argue that we cannot make a definite conclusion regarding\nthe order of the transition.\n"

At the\npumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of\ncoexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in\ncomputer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching\ndensity in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is\nclosely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange\nattractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the\nhigher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.\n"

At fields \\mu0H\nbetween 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-V\nisotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show\na scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex\nglass theory. However, at \\mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down\nto the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in\nterms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may\nbe caused by a mixture of \\sigma band vortices and \\pi band quasiparticles.\nInterestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled\naccording to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent\neffect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.\n"

Here we capture magnetic\n\"fingerprints\" of 1 billion Fe nanodots as they undergo a single domain to\nvortex state transition, using a first-order reversal curve (FORC) method. As\nthe nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal\nstriking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresis\nloops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivity\ndistribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a\ncalculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nm\nnanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of the\nvortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution and\nconfirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method gives\nquantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation\nand annihilation fields.\n"

Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are\nsolved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations.\nComparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the\nsame conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity\nprofile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of\nthe fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as\nviscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics.\nFor the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal\nviscous dynamics.

    "abstract": "  We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a\nnearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.\n"

The BSS distribution is highly peaked in the\ncluster center, decreases at intermediate radii and rises again outward. Such a\nbimodal distribution is similar to those previously observed in other globular\nclusters (M3, 47Tucanae, NGC6752). As for these clusters, dynamical simulations\nsuggest that, while the majority of BSS in M5 could be originated by stellar\ncollisions, a significant fraction (20-40%) of BSS generated by mass transfer\nprocesses in primordial binaries is required to reproduce the observed radial\ndistribution. A candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidal\nradius. If confirmed, this could represent an interesting case of an\n\"evaporating\" BSS.\n"

    "abstract": "  We model the essential features of eternal inflation on the landscape of a\ndense discretuum of vacua by the potential $V(\\phi)=V_{0},+\\delta V(\\phi)$,\nwhere $|\\delta V(\\phi)|\\ll V_{0},$ is random. We find that the diffusion of the\ndistribution function $\\rho(\\phi,t)$ of the inflaton expectation value in\ndifferent Hubble patches may be suppressed due to the effect analogous to the\nAnderson localization in disordered quantum systems. At $t \\to \\infty$ only the\nlocalized part of the distribution function $\\rho (\\phi, t)$ survives which\nleads to dynamical selection principle on the landscape. The probability to\nmeasure any but a small value of the cosmological constant in a given Hubble\npatch on the landscape is exponentially suppressed at $t\\to \\infty$.\n"

    "abstract": "  Vortices are pervasive in nature, representing the breakdown of laminar fluid\nflow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated\nwith a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\\Gamma=\\oint {\\rm d},{\\bf\nr},\\cdot{\\bf v},({\\bf r},)$ about the vortex, where ${\\bf v},({\\bf r},)$ is the\nfluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of\ncirculation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum\nis constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized\nvortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.\nIn BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including\nsingle vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent\nobservation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear\nsignature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In\naddition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear\noptics, and type-II superconductors.\n"

It is\nobserved that the ensemble approach is formally identical to the positive\noperator valued measures (POVM) on the quantum density matrix.

    "abstract": "  The longitudinal and transversal spin decoherence times, $T_1$ and $T_2$, in\nsemiconductor quantum dots are investigated from equation-of-motion approach\nfor different magnetic fields, quantum dot sizes, and temperatures. Various\nmechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the\nDresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon\ninteraction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due\nto the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the\nelectron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine\ninteraction are included. The relative contributions from these spin\ndecoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the\nspin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked\neffect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying\nboth the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either\nin Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite\ntemperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the\nFermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high\ntemperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the\nequation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin\ndephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,\nthough the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.\n"

    "abstract": "  The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond\nchains are investigated in three different cases: (a) J1, J2, J3>0\n(frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0\n(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is\ninvoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the\ntransfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore\nthe thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation\nfunctions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for\nthe three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks\nat wavevectors $q=a\\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero\nmagnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization\nplateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\\pi /3$ and\n$4\\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the\nzero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear\nsuperposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is\nobserved that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of\nthe system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the\nsusceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the\npeak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the\ncouplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings\nleads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,\nthe experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization\nfor the compound Cu$_{3},$(CO$_{3},$)$_{2},$(OH)$_{2},$ are fairly compared with\nour TMRG results.\n"

    "abstract": "  The extraction of a physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data about x\nand y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability\ndensity functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose\nkernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x)\nthe conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based\nupon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information\nand the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.\nWith the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the\nexperimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference\nbetween this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of\ndata represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the\ntrue properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the\nredundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number\nof data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual\ninformation is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the\nvariables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is\nused to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the\nintroduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomly\nrelated variables.\n"

In this scenario,\nthe fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is confined\nwithin the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae continue to explode. Only\nafter the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling\ndown and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these\nmetal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the next\ngenerations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets give\nrise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observed\nORL-CEL discrepancy.

The redundancy is expressed by the\nentropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of\nexperimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to\nintegration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy\nis derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about\nthese variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of\nthe redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and\ninformation cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of\nthe phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments\nneeded for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost\nfunction.

As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co,\nicosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have\nbeen constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of\nspecialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.\n"

    "title": "On smooth foliations with Morse singularities",
    "abstract": "  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\\infty$\nfoliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and\nclassification of pairs $(M,\\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In\nthis setting, a classical result due to Reeb \\cite{Reeb}, states that a manifold\nadmitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.\nIn particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these\nlines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \\cite{Ku-Ee}, classify manifolds having a\nreal-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In\nthe present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To\ndo this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities\nand the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an\nelimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle\nconfigurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if\nother classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,\nproved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At\nthis purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\\F)$ of the foliation $\\F$, we\nconsider {\\em{weakly stable},}, components, that we define as those components\nadmitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\\F)$ admits\nonly weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic\nto $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of\na closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type\nresult.\n"

    "abstract": "  In this paper we consider quiver gauge theories with fractional branes whose\ninfrared dynamics removes the classical supersymmetric vacua (DSB branes). We\nshow that addition of flavors to these theories (via additional non-compact\nbranes) leads to local meta-stable supersymmetry breaking minima, closely\nrelated to those of SQCD with massive flavors. We simplify the study of the\none-loop lifting of the accidental classical flat directions by direct\ncomputation of the pseudomoduli masses via Feynman diagrams. This new approach\nallows to obtain analytic results for all these theories. This work extends the\nresults for the $dP_1$ theory in hep-th/0607218. The new approach allows to\ngeneralize the computation to general examples of DSB branes, and for arbitrary\nvalues of the superpotential couplings.\n"

The anomalous first-order character of\nthe transition to the spin-Peierls phase is found to be a consequence of the\ndifferent symmetries of the incommensurate and spin-Peierls (P$2_{1},/m$)\nphases.\n  The pressure dependence of the lowest transition temperature strongly\nsuggests that magnetic interchain interactions play an important role in the\nformation of the spin-Peierls and the incommensurate phases. Finally, a\ncomparison of Raman data on VOCl to the TiOX spectra shows that the high energy\nscattering observed previously has a phononic origin.\n"

We analyse several relevant questions which have not\ndeserved full attention and pervade the extraction of $\\alpha$.\nReparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We\nshow that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or\ninadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the\nsingle weak phase $\\alpha$ just in the $\\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin\nrelations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\\alpha$\nthrough the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no\nrelevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most\nrelevant information, in terms of $\\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around\n$\\alpha\\sim \\pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New\nPhysics contributions to the $\\Delta I=1/2$ piece.\n"

The electronic transport properties\nof the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are\nmainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by\nthe perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated\non-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about\ntwo orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the\nexperimental measured results.

    "abstract": "  We report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of HE2347-4342, one of\nthe two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By\nanalysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse\nproximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:\nQSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,\n$\\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\\vartheta=16.28$\narcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably\ncreated by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the\ncorresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of\nthe extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the\nUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three\nforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background\nmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal\nline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints\non the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars\nshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of\nthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.\nThus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in\noverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.\nFurthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative\ntransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed\nspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of\nQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.\n"

They are submonoids of the multiplicative part of the Cuntz\nalgebra O_k. They are finitely generated, and their word problem over any\nfinite generating set is in P. Their word problem is coNP-complete over certain\ninfinite generating sets.\n  Changes in this version: Section 4 has been thoroughly revised, and errors\nhave been corrected; however, the main results of Section 4 do not change.\nSections 1, 2, and 3 are unchanged, except for the proof of Theorem 2.3, which\nwas incomplete; a complete proof was published in the Appendix of reference\n[6], and is also given here.\n"

For the purpose, we develop [Time\nSequential Monte Carlo Simulation] to extract the conclusion on the validity of\nthe SK assumption.

    "abstract": "  A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather\nunexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots\nare extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein\nfunction in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein\nData Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered\nones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most\ncomplex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that\nits entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the\nproteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and\nsometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only\nappears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of\nsimilar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the\nenzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a\nshort DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a\nknotted structure in this protein.\n"

We derive the rate equations describing\ndynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling.\nSolving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,\nas well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found\nthat in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are\ndirectly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,\ndepending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation\nholds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating\nenvironment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no\nlonger holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either\nin the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In\naddition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the\nstrong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.\n"

Lynch proved the conjecture only\nfor networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the\nBoolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary\nconnectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns\nout that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\\lambda$ is equivalent to the\nexpectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct\nthe network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the\naverage sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased\nfunctions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only\nfunctions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.\n"

We explain how to extract the type $B_n$\ndecomposition numbers from results of B\\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on\nmap enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new.\nThese results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and\nfixed integers $r_1\\le r_2\\le ...\\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\\pi_1\\le\n\\pi_2\\le ...\\le \\pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions\nposet, where the poset rank of $\\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the \"block\nstructure\" of $\\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies\nall known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing\npartitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain\nenumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras.\nMoreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain\nenumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which,\nin turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star\ncluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42\nclass II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I\nprotostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after\naccounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census\nof IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially\nwith the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around\na B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery\nabout 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find\nthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that\nrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,\nstarless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population\nindicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that\nthe IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its\nsmooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While\nit seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of\ndynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings\nsupport a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller\nsub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the\nsupposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should\nnot preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.\n"

We find that the spectrum is well described by a power-law plus\nblackbody model, with photon index Gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kT=160\neV. For the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to a 2-10 keV\nluminosity of about 1.2E+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energy\nchanneled by PSR J1357-6429 into X-ray emission is one of the lowest observed.\nThe Chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar and\nallow to set an upper limit of 3E+31 erg/s on the 2-10 keV luminosity of a\ncompact pulsar wind nebula.

High resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies of\nSN 1987A with {\\it Chandra}, reveal that X-ray emission of SN 1987A originates\nfrom the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like\ndense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor's\nequatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is now\nsweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is\nrapidly brightening in soft X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January),\nX-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\\rm X},$ $\\sim$ 2.4 $\\times$ 10$^{36},$ ergs\ns$^{-1},$ in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-component\nplane shock model with electron temperatures of $kT$ $\\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV. As\nthe shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-ray\nremnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$ $\\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1},$\nthan it was until 2004 ($v$ $\\sim$ 6000 km s$^{-1},$).\n"

    "abstract": "  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the\nreceiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively\nactivates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of\nRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\nfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\nentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\nsystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples\nshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only\nslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched\nfilter can require significantly more feedback.\n"

Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-ray\nemission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a\npower law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the\nX-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than\nthe radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly\noffset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7\narcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes Radio\nTelescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some\nareas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index\nof ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of\nL_{1400}, < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these\nobservational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or a\nlarge PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic model\nfor the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, we\nconclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula\nformed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly\n(<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs),\nlow ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a\nlow density (n~0.03 cm^{-3},) environment.\n"

Three-particle\ncorrelations have the power to distinguish the scenarios with conical emission,\nconical flow and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, the\ndependence of the observed shapes on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can\nbe used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and from\nQCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal\ncorrelations for a high $p_T$ trigger particle with two softer particles.\nResults are shown for $pp$, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN},},$=200 GeV. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction\nof combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction\nand the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implications\nof the results for the presence or absence of conical flow from Mach-cones are\ndiscussed.\n"

This provides a theoretical basis for further studying synchrotron\ndiagnostics, MHD shock acceleration of cosmic rays, and the nature of intense\nmagnetic field in compact objects.

We explore this\npossibility analizing XMM-Newton observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783.\nA detiled time-resolved spectral analysis is performed down to the shortest\npossible time-scales (few ks) using \"excess maps\" and cross-correlating light\ncurves in different energy bands. In addition to a constant core of the Fe K\nalpha line, we detected a variable and redshifted Fe K alpha emission feature\nbetween 5.3-6.1 keV. The line exhibits a modulation on a time-scale of 27 ks\nthat is similar to and in phase with a modulation of the 0.3-10 keV source\ncontinuum. The time-scale of the correlated variability of the redshifted Fe\nline and continuum agrees with the local dynamical time-scale of the accretion\ndisc at 10 r_g around a black hole of 10^7 M_sun. Given the shape of the\nredshfted line emission and the overall X-ray variability pattern, the line is\nlikely to arise from the relativistic region near the black hole.\n"

    "abstract": "  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an\napproach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and\nrepresentation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,\nin conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.\nNP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and related problems.\n"

    "abstract": "  The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the\ndescription of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the\ndiversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be\nidentified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type\nin the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic\nobservations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)\n1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have\nbeen previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been\nobtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in\nNovember and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep\nslope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of\n0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence\nof a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some\nquestions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has\nnever been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected\nit. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused\nby the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,\ntogether with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16\nmay be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main\nBelt.\n"

We find that measurements of the transverse mass distribution,\nreconstructed from this final state in the $W-W'$ interference region, provides\nthe best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requires\nintegrated luminosities of $\\sim 10(60) fb^{-1},$ assuming $M_{W'},=1.5(2.5)$ TeV\nand provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. This\nhelicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various\ndiscovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference\nregime, but with higher integrated luminosities.\n"

Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve\nbetter than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond\nwith careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric\nPLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope\nthat will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet\nmass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase\nastrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal\ncollecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy\nto 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass\nplanets possible.\n  RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique\nvolume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter\nspace of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large\nradii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the\ntargets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active\nstars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,\ncoronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity\nwill extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric\nmethods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.\n  The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods\ndemonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap\nfor exoplanet discovery and characterization.\n"

The study is\nbased on dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) for the infinite dimensional\nHubbard model with antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking. Self-consistent\nsolutions of the DMFT equations are calculated using the numerical\nrenormalization group (NRG). The low energy behavior in these results is then\nanalyzed in terms of renormalized quasiparticles. The parameters for these\nquasiparticles are calculated directly from the NRG derived self-energy, and\nalso from the low energy fixed point of the effective impurity. They are found\nto be in good agreement. We show that the main low energy features of the $\\bf\nk$-resolved spectral density can be understood in terms of the quasiparticle\npicture. We also find that Luttinger's theorem is satisfied for the total\nelectron number in the doped antiferromagnetic state.\n"

    "abstract": "  There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical\npossibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.\nThe basic idea of these invisibility devices \\cite{glu1, glu2, le},,\\cite{pss1},\nis to use anisotropic {\\it transformation media}, whose permittivity and\npermeability $\\var^{\\lambda\\nu},, \\mu^{\\lambda\\nu},$, are obtained from the ones,\n$\\var_0^{\\lambda\\nu},, \\mu^{\\lambda\\nu},_0$, of isotropic media, by singular\ntransformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking\nin the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.\nThis formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical\nproblems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the\npermeability of the {\\it transformation media}, on the boundary of the cloaked\nobjects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\\\"odinger form with the\nelectromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that\nthe electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially\nself-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily\nequivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium\n$\\var_0^{\\lambda\\nu},, \\mu^{\\lambda\\nu},_0$. Using this fact, and since the\ncoordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the\nscattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the\nconstruction of \\cite{glu1, glu2, le},, \\cite{pss1}, perfectly cloaks passive and\nactive devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove\ncloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove\nthat it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.\n"

We describe the main\npredictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical\nperturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the\nevolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require\nbetter KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly\nconsistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial\ncollisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important\nproblems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.\nContrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids\nsuggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification\nof more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide\nadditional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and\ndynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate\ncalculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'\ncalculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and\nevolution.\n"

    "abstract": "  (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak\nlensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging\ngalaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\nconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight\nimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out\nmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the\nstandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.\n"

These effects\nare not limited to reproducing the well known contributions of the gauge theory\ninstantons but also generate extra terms in the superpotential or the\nprepotential. On these brane instantons there are some neutral fermionic\nzero-modes in addition to the ones expected from broken supertranslations. They\nare crucial in correctly reproducing effects which are dual to gauge theory\ninstantons, but they may make some other interesting contributions vanish. We\nanalyze how orientifold projections can remove these zero-modes and thus allow\nfor new superpotential terms. These terms contribute to the dynamics of the\neffective gauge theory, for instance in the stabilization of runaway\ndirections.\n"

By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS\n2155-304 in the infrared-optical band, we explore variability on the scales of\nmonths, days and hours. We made our observations with the robotic 60 cm\ntelescope REM located at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS\n2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval\nexplored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time\nrender our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.\nOn the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states\nof the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in\nthe literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the\nH band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the\nV band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary\nto the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of\nNovember we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability\nepisode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare\nwith t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.\n"

Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the\ndereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H\nfor all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor\nstar, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In\naddition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with\nrespect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting\nthe spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison\nof the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO\nabsorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf\nstars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the\nspectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is\nobtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star\ncontribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%. Combined with\nprevious published results from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al.\n(1994), this gives a precise mass for the black hole in A0620-00 of M_BH =\n9.7+-0.6 M_solar.\n"

    "abstract": "  The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelength\nmonitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with\nflux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very\nhigh energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet\nmodel to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our\nmultiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce\nthe observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value\nfor the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due\nto the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the\nhigh-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence\nof a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role\nin the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to\nthe central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and\ngamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton\nemission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral\nvariability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis\npatterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day\ntime scales.\n"

    "abstract": "  Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of\nplanetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection\nadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and\nreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated\nthan the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf\nwith and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn\nfrom the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that\nthe host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary\nsystem.\n"

The observed region includes\nthe\n  S140 H${\\alpha},$ arc. This spectral line is seen here in absorption against\nthe cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm\nmolecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO\nand CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant\ndifferences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly\ncoincident with the S140 H${\\alpha},$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is\nclearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that\nthese differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.\nThe CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than\nthe H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easily\nphotodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas\nlocated immediately behind Photon Dominated Regions.\n"

    "abstract": "  Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the\nenvelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the\ndonor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative\nenvelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be\nresponsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate\ncomponents, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period\nbinaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct\nthe evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more\nproblematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either\nduring the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the\nfirst white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common\nenvelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive\nwhite dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents\ninterpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope\nevolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual\nformulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most\nplausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the\ncommon envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget\nexplicitly including recombination resolves this issue.\n"

Next we turn to the\nissue of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment in\nboth canonical and grand canonical ensembles.

    "abstract": "  We investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star clusters using\nN-body models of up to 100000 stars. Primordial binary frequencies in these\nmodels range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and\ninclude a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and\nthe tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a\ncluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late\ntimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the\ncentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time\n-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core\nbinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase\n(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in\nthe core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of\nmass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces\nthe observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled\ninto and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in\nstars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius\nup to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the\nexact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or\nless). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial\nbinary content of globular clusters.\n"

    "abstract": "  Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event\nparticles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding\ninfrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable\nby adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order\nhigher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless\ncone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only\nexisting approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it\nunusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to\ncode (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint\nimplementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an\nanalytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any\n'R_{sep},' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and\nhadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless\nalgorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through\nreduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some\nmulti-jet observables.\n"

    "abstract": "  We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen\n(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white\ndwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an\nelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,\nunless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than\nearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central\nregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,\nbe approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a\nslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a\ncentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that\nmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar\nevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by\nneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and\nthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective\naccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\nof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\nCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that\nat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good\ncandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the\ncharacteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual\nexplosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).\n"

    "abstract": "  We present an experimental investigation on the scaling of resistance in\nindividual single walled carbon nanotube devices with channel lengths that vary\nfour orders of magnitude on the same sample. The electron mean free path is\nobtained from the linear scaling of resistance with length at various\ntemperatures. The low temperature mean free path is determined by impurity\nscattering, while at high temperature the mean free path decreases with\nincreasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by electron-phonon\nscattering. An unusually long mean free path at room temperature has been\nexperimentally confirmed. Exponentially increasing resistance with length at\nextremely long length scales suggests anomalous localization effects.\n"

While his concise\ndefinition inspired a new line of research on analog computation, it contains\nsome technical inaccuracies. Focusing on his \"primitive recursive\" functions,\nwe pin down what is problematic and discuss possible attempts to remove the\nambiguity regarding the behavior of the differential recursion operator on\npartial functions. It turns out that in any case the purported relation to\ndifferentially algebraic functions, and hence to Shannon's model of analog\ncomputation, fails.\n"

    "abstract": "  For the past two decades, single-index model, a special case of projection\npursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high\ndimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weakly\ndependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model which\nis robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index is\nidentified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of\nthe response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a\ngenuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for\nthe single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent\nand asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is\nsufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within\nseconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates\nwith the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the rive\nflow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.\n"

    "abstract": "  Air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra-high energy cosmic\nrays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along the\nextensive air shower cascade. To ensure a reliable energy determination, the\nlight signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not only\nattenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible background component\ndue to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple-scattered light. The correction\nrequires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol\nphase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a given\ndirection. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phase\nfunction is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF)\nlight sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view of\nthe fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the image\nof the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes the\ndesign, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of the\nAPF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.\n"

However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition,\nare described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently\nas information becoming more complex.\n  The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple\nscales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic,\npsychological, philosophical, and complexity principles.

Phase contrast and polarization\nmicroscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the\npolymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional\nforce. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity\ncurve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT\nbundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network.

    "abstract": "  Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in\ntheir protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the\ncircumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has\nbeen unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the\nouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in\naccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest\nitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a\nsearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic\nbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that\nthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16\n+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13\ndays, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The\nbrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall\nperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than\nhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as\nclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component\nis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with\npredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to\nthose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from\ncircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the\ntimescale over which they might form planets.\n"

    "abstract": "  The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networks\nhas uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.\nTherefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these\nnetworked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more\ndetailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of\nnetwork growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose\nan evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network\nstructure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network\nstructure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of\nthe network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the\nintensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial\ndisassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of\nnetwork evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting\nintroduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network\nso long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,\nit is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world\neffect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering\ncoefficient in a network.\n"

We aimed at imaging the structure of GPS\nsources, searching for Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) and studying the\nabsorption for the convex radio spectra of GPS sources.\n  Results: We obtained total intensity 1.6 GHz VLBI images of 17 sources for\nthe first time.

Magnetic images of high density vertically recorded media using these\ntips exhibit a doubling of the spatial frequency under some conditions.

This results in a signal which is\nproportional to the absolute value of the signal normally observed in MFM.

The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct\nmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for\nboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it\nstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type\ngalaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function\nwith a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope\n(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy\nsample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and\nintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local\nmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,\nearly-type}, = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70}, M_sun Mpc^{-3},, and in late-type\ngalaxies rho_{bh, late-type}, = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70}, M_sun Mpc^{-3},. The\nuncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include\nuncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the\ngalaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive\nblack hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total}, = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6}, h_70.\nThat is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003)\nh^3_{70}, per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up in\nsupermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.\n"

For both of these cases the effect\nof the Dirac sea is estimated.

    "abstract": "  Based on the finite $U$ slave boson method, we have investigated the effect\nof Rashba spin-orbit(SO) coupling on the persistent charge and spin currents in\nmesoscopic ring with an Anderson impurity. It is shown that the Kondo effect\nwill decrease the magnitude of the persistent charge and spin currents in this\nside-coupled Anderson impurity case. In the presence of SO coupling, the\npersistent currents change drastically and oscillate with the strength of SO\ncoupling. The SO coupling will suppress the Kondo effect and restore the abrupt\njumps of the persistent currents. It is also found that a persistent spin\ncurrent circulating the ring can exist even without the charge current in this\nsystem.\n"

    "abstract": "  We investigate the growth of half metallic phase in a ferromagnetic material\nusing state-of-the-art full potential linearized augmented plane wave method.\nTo address the issue, we have substituted Ti at the Ru-sites in SrRuO3, where\nSrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic material. Calculated results establish Ti4+ valence\nstates (similar to SrTiO3), which was predicted experimentally. Thus, Ti\nsubstitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in the\ncalculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finite\ngap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appears\nat the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spin\nstates contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallic\nferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ti\nconcentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneck\nto achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials.\nThis study, thus, provides a novel but simple way to fabricate half-metallicity\nin ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-based\ntechnology.\n"

The advantage of using\nRiesz-Feller derivative lies in the fact that the solution of the fractional\nreaction-diffusion equation containing this derivative includes the fundamental\nsolution for space-time fractional diffusion, which itself is a generalization\nof neutral fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and\ntime-fractional diffusion. These specialized types of diffusion can be\ninterpreted as spatial probability density functions evolving in time and are\nexpressible in terms of the H-functions in compact form.\n"

The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,\nwhich plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,\nand suggested a value for ar.

For the tribofilms containing MoDTC together\nwith ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPa\nthrough some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 <\n$\\mu$ < 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm.\nThis low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planes\nsliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when the\npressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.\n"

    "title": "Lattice Boltzmann inverse kinetic approach for the incompressible\n  Navier-Stokes equations",
    "abstract": "  In spite of the large number of papers appeared in the past which are devoted\nto the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain\nunchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a\ndiscrete kinetic theory which yields \\textit{exactly}, the fluid equations,\ni.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \\textit{LB inverse kinetic theory},).\nThe purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse\nkinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this\nproblem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important\nrequirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that\nit yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but\nsuitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the\nboundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem\ncan be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial\ndistribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic\napproximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations\n\\textit{with prescribed accuracy.}, As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates\nof customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial\ncompressibility method are discussed.\n"

    "abstract": "  We study phonon-mediated transitions between translational levels of an atom\nin a surface-induced potential. We present a general master equation governing\nthe dynamics of the translational states of the atom. In the framework of the\nDebye model, we derive compact expressions for the rates for both upward and\ndownward transitions. Numerical calculations for the transition rates are\nperformed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of\nbound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rate\nis shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep\nbound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels.\nMoreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of\nmagnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones.\nWe also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for\nthermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\\mu$K to 400\n$\\mu$K in the vicinity of a silica surface with temperature of 300 K, the\nadsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than the\nheating (free-to-free upward decay) rate, while the cooling (free-to-free\ndownward decay) rate is negligible.\n"

    "abstract": "  A number of giant HII regions are associated with soft diffuse X-ray\nemission. Among these, the Carina nebula possesses the brightest soft diffuse\nemission. The required plasma temperature and thermal energy can be produced by\ncollisions or termination of fast winds from main-sequence or embedded young O\nstars, but the extended emission is often observed from regions apart from\nmassive stellar clusters. The origin of the X-ray emission is unknown.\n  The XIS CCD camera onboard Suzaku has the best spectral resolution for\nextended soft sources so far, and is therefore capable of measuring key\nemission lines in the soft band. Suzaku observed the core and the eastern side\nof the Carina nebula (Car-D1) in 2005 Aug and 2006 June, respectively. Spectra\nof the south part of the core and Car-D1 similarly showed strong L-shell lines\nof iron ions and K-shell lines of silicon ions, while in the north of the core\nthese lines were much weaker. Fitting the spectra with an absorbed thin-thermal\nplasma model showed kT~0.2, 0.6 keV and NH~1-2e21 cm-2 with a factor of 2-3\nabundance variation in oxygen, magnesium, silicon and iron. The plasma might\noriginate from an old supernova, or a super shell of multiple supernovae.\n"

We obtained data on 47 objects, 23 belonging to the L5 swarm\nand 24 to the L4 one. These data together with those already published by\nFornasier et al. (2004a) and Dotto et al. (2006), constitute a total sample of\nvisible spectra for 80 objects. The survey allows us to investigate six\nfamilies (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5\ncloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6). The\nsample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exception\nof the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- and\nP-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the\nexception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is\ndetected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type\nasteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer\ntransition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans\nas compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the\nproperties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The\nanalysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows\nthat the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We\nperform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property\ndistributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in\ncomparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System.\nTrojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher\ninclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.\n"

The resulting maps are\npresented along with unpublished 8.4-GHz VLA images of five sources. Some of\nthe sources discussed here show a complex radio morphology and therefore a\ncomplicated past that, in some cases, might indicate intermittent activity. One\nof the sources studied - 1045+352 - is known as a powerful radio and\ninfrared-luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. It is a young CSS object\nwhose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs,\nextending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. The\nyoung age and compact structure of 1045+352 is consistent with the evolution\nscenario of BAL quasars. It has also been confirmed that the submillimetre flux\nof 1045+352 can be seriously contaminated by synchrotron emission.\n"

In analyses\nundertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance\nmeasurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk\nobjects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo\ndark matter residing in such objects.\n  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white\ndwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the\nstars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August\n2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined\nyielding relative errors on distances of $\\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\\sim12$% for\n3 objects, and $\\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too\ndistant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our\nobservations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were\nderived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo\nmembership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be\nthick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based\nsolely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric\nparallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as\nderived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise\nthe halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a\nsubsequent publication.\n"

This may have implications\nfor gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core\ncollapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,\nperformed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low\nT/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the\nnonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which\nshow that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the\ncorotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode\ndeformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are\nconfirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an\nimportant role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,\nwhich has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable\namplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.\n"

    "title": "Evolutionary games on minimally structured populations",
    "abstract": "  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general\nnetworks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have\na fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These\neffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying\ntopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is\ndescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this\nmodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on\nthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\nstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\ncooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's\ndilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\nstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\nwith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\nthe emergence of global oscillations.\n"

    "abstract": "  We explore the effect of an inhomogeneous mass density field on frequencies\nand wave profiles of torsional Alfven oscillations in solar coronal loops.\nDispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in\nlimits of weak and strong inhomogeneities. These analytical results are\nverified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of\ninhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field\nleads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in\ncomparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This\nfrequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far\nas the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion\nrelations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of\ntorsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line\nwidths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a\ndevelopment of coronal seismology.\n"

    "abstract": "  It has been observed that particular rate-1/2 partially systematic parallel\nconcatenated convolutional codes (PCCCs) can achieve a lower error floor than\nthat of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Nevertheless, good puncturing patterns can\nonly be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towards\nlow bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a\nrate-1/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, we\npresent and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we\ncall pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate\nperformance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of\ntheir rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to\nsimulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards the\nerror floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic\noutput. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of\nimproving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its\nerror floor.\n"

Above the metal-insulator\ntransition related to the anion ordering the optical conductivity spectra show\na Drude-like response. Below the transition an energy gap of about 1500 cm-1\n(185 meV) opens, leading to the corresponding charge transfer band in the\noptical conductivity spectra. The analysis of the infrared-active vibrations\ngives evidence for the long-range crystal structure modulation below the\ntransition temperature and for the short-range order fluctuations of the\nlattice modulation above the transition temperature. Also we report about a new\ninfrared mode at around 710 cm-1 with a peculiar temperature behavior, which\nhas so far not been observed in any other (TMTSF)2X salt showing a\nmetal-insulator transition. A qualitative model based on the coupling between\nthe TMTSF molecule vibration and the reorientation of electrical dipole moment\nof the FSO3 anion is proposed, in order to explain the anomalous behavior of\nthe new mode.\n"

Consequently one always generalizes the\nCartesian prescription to other coordinates and falls in a trap.

We have tried to point out most\nof the elementary quantum mechanical results, related to the momentum operator,\nwhich has coordinate dependence. We explicitly calculate the momentum\nexpectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation value\nreally turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentum\nexpectation value is real. We comment briefly on the status of the angular\nvariables in quantum mechanics and the problems related in interpreting them as\ndynamical variables. At the end, we calculate the Heisenberg's equation of\nmotion for the radial component of the momentum for the Hydrogen atom.\n"

The gases of the three flames contain 20.9% (molar) of methane\nand 33.4% of oxygen, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.25 for the pure\nmethane flame. In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to\na ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have\nbeen stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,\nwith a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentration\nprofiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after sampling\nwith a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide and\ndioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne,\nallene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene,\n1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a\nPtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from\n700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results,\nsome improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our\nlaboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The main\nreaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6\naromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.\n"

The result\nfor the muon is Im$ \\mu = e G_F^2 m^3/768 \\pi^3$, with $e$ the charge and $m$\nthe mass of the muon, $G_F$ the Fermi constant, which in an external magnetic\nfield of $B$ Tesla give rise to the relative change in the muon lifetime of\n$3\\times 10^{-15}, B$. For neutron the effect is of a similar magnitude. We\nspeculate on the observable implications of this effect.\n"

From classical results of Schmidt-Spitzer and\nHirschman it is known that the eigenvalues accumulate on a special curve in the\ncomplex plane and the normalized eigenvalue counting measure converges weakly\nto a measure on this curve as $n\\to\\infty$.

Our approach will include identification of an\nexplicit two-phase mechanism by which particles can build up in sufficient\nnumbers with spatial positions near $-\\gamma t$ and type positions near $\\kappa\n\\sqrt{t},$ at large times $t$. The proofs involve the application of a variety\nof martingale techniques--most importantly a ``spine'' construction involving a\nchange of measure with an additive martingale. In addition to the model's\nintrinsic interest, the methodologies presented contain ideas that will adapt\nto other branching settings. We also briefly discuss applications to traveling\nwave solutions of an associated reaction--diffusion equation.\n"

We perform our\nanalysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded\nincluding a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the\nchannel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter\nspace at the CNGS beam is $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau$. The reason for that is\ntwofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation\nis the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for\nwhich both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an\nextremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\\nu_\\mu\n\\to \\nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile\nneutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is\nsignificantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.\nData from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the\nfour-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of\n$\\Dmq_\\Sbl \\gtrsim 0.1 \\eVq$, \\textit{i.e.}, when oscillations driven by this\nmass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on\n$\\theta_{13},$ that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possible\nexistence of sterile neutrinos.\n"

    "abstract": "  We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits\naround a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in\nQ, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.\nThis system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation\nreaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the\nCarter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of\nthese three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has\ncomputed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is\nlinear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in\nthe spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction\nfield), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the\nquadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric\norbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry\naxis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a\nsingle mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,\nto linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we\nshow that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a\nsystem (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional\nassumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric\nspacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.\n"

Advances in the analysis of complex\nnetworks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and\nfunctional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks\nrecently described allow their characterization as small-world, random\n(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that\nhave been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,\nhodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network\nanalysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and\nmacaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark\nrewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis\nstrategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and\nconnections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain\nnetworks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free\nnetworks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck\nconnections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain\nsystems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'\nconnectivity.\n"

    "abstract": "  Semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) living in the closures of\ndomains with piecewise smooth boundaries are of interest in applied probability\nbecause of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic\nnetworks. In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains and\ndirections of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, for\nSRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that\nsatisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in\nthe defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial\ningredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for\nsolutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to\nshow weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance\nprinciple, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some\nsufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in\nconvex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the\npolyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries\nand possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.\n"

In agreement\nwith previous predictions, we find that the radiation can lead to large\nenhancements of the conductance of such contacts by bringing off-resonant\nlevels into resonance through photoassisted processes. In our analysis we make\nuse of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the\nphotoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in the\nabsence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated for\noligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is\ncalculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponential\ndecay of the conductance with the length of the molecule can be replaced by a\nlength-independent value in the presence of radiation.\n"

    "abstract": "  An analysis of the relation between radio surface brightness and diameter,\nso-called Sigma-D relation, for planetary nebulae (PNe) is presented: i) the\ntheoretical Sigma-D relation for the evolution of bremsstrahlung surface\nbrightness is derived; ii) contrary to the results obtained earlier for the\nGalactic supernova remnant (SNR) samples, our results show that the updated\nsample of Galactic PNe does not severely suffer from volume selection effect -\nMalmquist bias (same as for the extragalactic SNR samples) and; iii) we\nconclude that the empirical Sigma-D relation for PNe derived in this paper is\nnot useful for valid determination of distances for all observed PNe with\nunknown distances.\n"

    "abstract": "  A Relativistic Transport Model (ART1.0) is applied to simulate the stopping\neffects in tip-tip and body-body U+U collisions, at a beam kinetic energy of\n520 MeV/nucleon. Our simulation results have demonstrated that both central\ncollisions of the two extreme orientations can achieve full stopping, and also\nform a bulk of hot, dense nuclear matter with a sufficiently large volume and\nlong duration, due to the largely deformed uranium nuclei. The nucleon sideward\nflow in the tip-tip collisions is nearly 3 times larger than that in body-body\nones at normalized impact parameter $b/b_{max},<0.5$, and that the body-body\ncentral collisions have a largest negative nucleon elliptic flow $v_{2},=-12%$\nin contrast to zero in tip-tip ones. Thus the extreme circumstance and the\nnovel experimental observables in tip-tip and body-body collisions can provide\na good condition and sensitive probe to study the nuclear EoS, respectively.\nThe Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External Target Facility (ETF) to be built at\nLanzhou, China, delivering the uranium beam up to 520 MeV/nucleon is expected\nto make significant contribution to explore the nuclear equation of state\n(EoS).\n"

    "abstract": "  Instead of using local field equations - like the Dirac equation for spin-1/2\nand the Klein-Gordon equation for spin-0 particles - one could try to use\nnon-local field equations in order to describe scattering processes. The latter\nequations can be obtained by means of the relativistic energy together with the\ncorrespondence principle, resulting in equations with a square root operator.\nBy coupling them to an electromagnetic field and expanding the square root (and\ntaking into account terms of quadratic order in the electromagnetic coupling\nconstant e), it is possible to calculate scattering matrix elements within the\nframework of quantum electrodynamics, e.g. like those for Compton scattering or\nfor the scattering of two identical particles. This will be done here for the\nscalar case. These results are then compared with the corresponding ones based\non the Klein-Gordon equation. A proposal of how to transfer these reflections\nto the spin-1/2 case is also presented.\n"

We estimate the\nimpact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in the\nfirst galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II and\nPop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces the\nformation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x is\nthe mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photons\nthat escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity and\nk_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source.\nBy the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H-\nphotodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, the\nprimordial star formation rate, delaying the progress of reionization.\n"

We detect and confirm the protostellar\nstatus for the near-infrared source CB54YC1-II. The mid-infrared luminosity for\nCB54YC1-II was found to be $L_{midir}, \\approx 8 L_\\sun$, and we estimate a\ncentral source mass of $M_* \\approx 0.8 M_\\sun$ (for a mass accretion rate of\n${\\dot M},=10^{-6}, M_\\sun yr^{-1},$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source\n(CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is\nconsistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B\nstar or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is\nthat the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high\ninclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central\nprotostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.\nIn addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are\nspatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source\ntemperatures ($\\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the\ndense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0\nprotostars.\n"

We use considerations in the maximal\ncoordinate neighborhoods to give simple proofs of some of the basic facts about\nthe Delzant space, as a reduced phase space, and as a toric variety.

    "abstract": "  We show that all static spacetimes in higher dimensions are of Weyl types G,\nI_i, D or O. This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional\nconditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The\nconclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing\nhorizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped\nproduct spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas\nwarped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to\nthe types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the\nsimplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,\npossibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that\nthe spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''\ntype D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are\ngeodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,\nhowever, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit\nnon-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in\nany n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D\nWeyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \\Phi_{ij},. In the case with\n``twistfree'' (A_{ij},=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''\ncase \\Phi_{ij}, is symmetric and eigenvectors of \\Phi_{ij}, coincide with those\nof the expansion matrix S_{ij},, providing us with three preferred spacelike\ndirections of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing\nthe twistfree condition and assuming instead that \\Phi_{ij}, is symmetric. The\nn=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are\nbriefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.\n"

These channels may dominate over all other channels if the Higgs\nboson is light. For a Higgs boson mass larger than $2 m_W$ the new decays are\nsubdominant yet still of interest. The right-handed neutrinos have macroscopic\ndecay lengths and decay mostly into final states containing leptons and quarks.\nA distinguishing collider signature of this scenario is a pair of displaced\nvertices violating lepton number. A general operator analysis is performed\nusing the minimal flavor violation hypothesis to illustrate that these novel\ndecay processes can occur while remaining consistent with experimental\nconstraints on lepton number violating processes. In this context the question\nof whether these new decay modes dominate is found to depend crucially on the\napproximate flavor symmetries of the right-handed neutrinos.\n"

    "title": "Evidence for a planetary companion around a nearby young star",
    "abstract": "  We report evidence for a planetary companion around the nearby young star HD\n70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age\nestimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations\nof this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our\nspectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about\n100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored\nsince December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within\nthis period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a\nperiod of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of\nthis variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3\ndays. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff\nvariation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation\nbetween the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the\nrotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the\nlong-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass\ncompanion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial\nvelocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host\nstar, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which\nlies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.\nThe orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery\naround the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris\ndisks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.\n"

    "abstract": "  Katz and Vafa showed how charged matter can arise geometrically by the\ndeformation of ADE-type orbifold singularities in type IIa, M-theory, and\nF-theory compactifications. In this paper we use those same basic ingredients,\nused there to geometrically engineer specific matter representations, here to\ndeform the compactification manifold itself in a way which naturally\ncompliments many features of unified model building. We realize this idea\nexplicitly by deforming a manifold engineered to give rise to an $SU_5$ grand\nunified model into a one giving rise to the Standard Model. In this framework,\nthe relative local positions of the singularities giving rise to Standard Model\nfields are specified in terms of the values of a small number of complex\nstructure moduli which deform the original manifold, greatly reducing the\narbitrariness of their relative positions.\n"

    "abstract": "  This paper extends and builds upon the results of an earlier paper, in which\nwe described how to use the tools of geometrical engineering to deform\ngeometrically-engineered grand unified models into ones with lower symmetry.\nThis top-down unfolding has the advantage that the relative positions of\nsingularities giving rise to the many `low energy' matter fields are related by\nonly a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. And\nbecause the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the\nsuperpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of\ngeometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.\n  In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case of\ndeforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model\ncontent. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometrically\nengineered 16 of SO(10) can be unfolded into the Standard Model, and how the\nthree families of the Standard Model uniquely emerge from the unfolding of a\nsingle, isolated E8 singularity.\n"

    "title": "Giant Planet Migration in Viscous Power-Law Discs",
    "abstract": "  Many extra-solar planets discovered over the past decade are gas giants in\ntight orbits around their host stars. Due to the difficulties of forming these\n`hot Jupiters' in situ, they are generally assumed to have migrated to their\npresent orbits through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper, we\npresent a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We\nfind that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface\ndensity. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is\nsimply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be\nobtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous\ntorque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by\nadjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at\nwhich the planet is released to migrate.\n"

As we found in\nPart A [hep-th/0703182], the integral homology group H_2(X,Z)=Z^3 + Z_3 + Z_3\ncontains torsion curves. Using the B-model on the mirror of X as well as its\ncovering spaces, we compute the instanton numbers. We observe that X is\nself-mirror even at the quantum level. Using the self-mirror property, we\nderive the complete prepotential on X, going beyond the results of Part A. In\nparticular, this yields the first example where the instanton number depends on\nthe torsion part of its homology class. Another consequence is that the\nthreefold X provides a non-toric example for the conjectured exchange of\ntorsion subgroups in mirror manifolds.\n"

    "abstract": "  We report results from a 30 ks observation of Cygnus X-1 with the High Energy\nTransmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on board the {\\em Chandra X-ray\nObservatory},. Numerous absorption lines were detected in the HETGS spectrum.\nThe lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,\nsome of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,\nhowever, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of\nthe present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \\AA\\\nwas about $5 \\times 10^{-3},$ photons cm$^{-2},$ s$^{-1},$ in the early part of\nthe observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of\n$0.06 \\times 10^{-3},$ photons cm$^{-2},$ s$^{-1},$ on the flux of the line. This\nimplies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale\nof hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the\nobservation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are\ngenerally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the\nbinary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical\ncondition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.\n"

This includes analogs to\nall the Solar System's planets except for Mercury, as well as most types of\nplanets predicted by planet formation theories. Such a survey will provide\nresults on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with\nshort lifetimes. Close-in planets with separations < 0.5 AU are invisible to a\nspace-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by Kepler. Other\nmethods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach the comprehensive\nstatistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets\nthat a space-based microlensing survey will provide. The terrestrial planet\nsensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of\nthe Einstein radius at 2-3 AU, and space-based imaging is needed to identify\nand determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of\nplanets discovered by microlensing. Thus, a space-based microlensing survey is\nlikely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature\nof planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation and\nhabitability.

We show that the magnitudes of\nthese RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the\nlocations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the\npresence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic\nquadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.\nTo quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider\nall available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and\njointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows\nthe spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth\nGalactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm\n(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in\nthe Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,\nin which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed\ncounter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent\npulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs\ndemonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not\nrequired to account for observations.\n"

The\ntelescope surveys a set of 26 x 26 degree fields, together covering about 25%\nof the Northern sky, targeting stars in the range of 8<V<10 mag, searching for\ntransits by close-in Jupiters.

    "abstract": "  Simple examples are constructed that show the entanglement of two qubits\nbeing both increased and decreased by interactions on just one of them. One of\nthe two qubits interacts with a third qubit, a control, that is never entangled\nor correlated with either of the two entangled qubits and is never entangled,\nbut becomes correlated, with the system of those two qubits. The two entangled\nqubits do not interact, but their state can change from maximally entangled to\nseparable or from separable to maximally entangled. Similar changes for the two\nqubits are made with a swap operation between one of the qubits and a control;\nthen there are compensating changes of entanglement that involve the control.\nWhen the entanglement increases, the map that describes the change of the state\nof the two entangled qubits is not completely positive. Combination of two\nindependent interactions that individually give exponential decay of the\nentanglement can cause the entanglement to not decay exponentially but,\ninstead, go to zero at a finite time.\n"

    "abstract": "  The Sun was recently predicted to be an extended source of gamma-ray\nemission, produced by inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic-ray electrons with\nthe solar radiation. The emission was predicted to contribute to the diffuse\nextragalactic background even at large angular distances from the Sun. While\nthis emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by GLAST, the\nsituation for available EGRET data is more challenging. We present a detailed\nstudy of the EGRET database, using a time dependent analysis, accounting for\nthe effect of the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, which\ninterfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested on the moon\nsignal, with results consistent with previous work. We find clear evidence for\nemission from the Sun and its vicinity.

    "abstract": "  We present photometric detections of dust emission at 850 and 450 micron\naround the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7 using the SCUBA camera on the James\nClerk Maxwell Telescope. These data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk\naround TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron\nflux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)\nassuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes\nthe TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk\nreported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk\ndetected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly\nyounger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the\ndisk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the\ndust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures\naccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a\nmodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures\naccording to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in\nthe TW Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of\ndisks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs.\ndebris) as a function of spectral type.\n"

    "abstract": "  We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamental\nproperties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray\nbinary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our\nwork mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided\nhigh-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably\nmodeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the\ndetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is often\nempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum\nfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be\npre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion\nrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier\nsuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the\ndisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can\nbe fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color\ncorrection factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra\nwith other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is\ndominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by\nstate-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.\n"

The Suzaku observation confirms the presence of the soft\nexcess emission, but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII lines\nin the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from XMM-Newton\nobservations show that the soft excess emission has a strong peak at the\nposition of the central cD galaxy and the maps do not show any significant\nazimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally\nwell with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is\nneither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with\nmodels of clumpy warm intracluster gas associated with infalling groups. Using\nthe data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do not\nconfirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with the expected\nproperties assuming the soft excess is of thermal origin. The observed\nproperties of the soft excess emission are consistent with the non-thermal\ninterpretation. While the high density of relativistic electrons associated\nwith the peak of the soft emission in the cluster centre might have been\nprovided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD galaxy, the underlying\npopulation might have been accelerated in diffuse shocks.\n"

We incorporate a new method for including the\nradiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars,\nled to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to\nthe low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with\ncosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with\nmetallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The\nsimulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5\nMsolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core\nreveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4\nZsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with\nmetallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share\nmost of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass\nproto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=\n10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower\nlimit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second\ngeneration stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more\nmassive on average than stars formed in the local universe.\n"

We therefore apply the Virial Theorem to derive the\nkinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have masses of 2 x 10^5 to 4 x 10^6\nsolar masses, with a total population mass of 1.4 x 10^7 solar masses.\nComparison of the loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globular\nclusters in a plot of radius versus velocity dispersion suggests that the SSCs\nare a population of potential globular clusters. We present the mass function\nfor the SSCs, and find a power law fit with an index of gamma = -1.91 +/- 0.06.\nThis result is nearly identical to the mass function of young SSCs in the\nAntennae galaxies.\n"

    "abstract": "  About 25% of the Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) exhibit unusually extended\ncolor distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This\nphenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced\nsecond generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these\npeculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with\nextended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.\nThe GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by\nrandom motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.\nSurprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner\nhalo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the\nformation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic\nproperties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion\norigin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we\nanticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of\nMilky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.\n"

Illuminate through an analysis and ex.3 that there is a\nlogic error during deduction of fact 1.2, which causes each of fact 1.2, 1.3, 4\nto be invalid. Demonstrate through ex.4 and 5 that each or the combination of\nqu+1 > qu * D at fact 4 and table 1 at fact 2.2 is not sufficient for f(i) +\nf(j) = f(k), property 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each are invalid, and alg.1 based on fact 4\nand alg.2 based on table 1 are disordered and wrong logically. Further,\nmanifest through a repeated experiment and ex.5 that the data at table 2 is\nfalsified, and the example in [8] is woven elaborately. We explain why Cx = Ax\n* W^f(x) (% M) is changed to Cx = (Ax * W^f(x))^d (% M) in REESSE1+ v2.1. To\nthe signature fraud, we point out that [8] misunderstands the existence of T^-1\nand Q^-1 % (M-1), and forging of Q can be easily avoided through moving H.\nTherefore, the conclusion of [8] that REESSE1+ is not secure at all (which\nconnotes that [8] can extract a related private key from any public key in\nREESSE1+) is fully incorrect, and as long as the parameter Omega is fitly\nselected, REESSE1+ with Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is secure.\n"

It is also found that\nthese phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface\nmodel is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model\nby using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.\nThe mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no\ntwo-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are\ncomposed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a\ncompartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of\ntriangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an\ninhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside\nthe compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.\nHowever, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;\nthere is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases\nmentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending\nrigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the\nfluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.\n"

The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used\nto probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is\nexcited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric\nsystems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the\nfused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and\nvibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR\nenergy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental\ndata, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also\nquantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the\npre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be\nsuitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive\nbeams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.\n"

Given the\nmyriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing\nproblem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the\nsource to the destination. We find that for a given route, the\ndecode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative\ncoding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by\nthe usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative\ncoding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms\nof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm\nruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that\nruns in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when\nthe nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies\nusing practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of\nthe strategies on different routes.\n"

The individuals of each species are\nlocalized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rules\nare inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels of\nmean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent to\nan extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized\nby prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation\nis capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The\npair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of\nprey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and\nanother displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population\ndensities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through\na Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions\nand, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on\ninitial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically more\nrealistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.\n"

Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are\nknown, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved\nspectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the\nIP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains\na white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We\nestimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \\approx 2 x 10^33 G\ncm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed\nshort-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest\nthat long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards\nshorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,\nwhich have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their\norbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with\nspin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.\n"

    "abstract": "  Aiming at a better understand of the physical and chemical processes in the\nhot molecular core stage of high-mass star formation, we observed the\nprototypical hot core G29.96-0.02 in the 862mu band with the Submillimeter\nArray (SMA) at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution. The observations resolved the\nhot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial\nresolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located\nwithin 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar\ndensities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows\nus to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature\nstructure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core\ntemperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial\ndifferentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced\nat the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature\nsensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The\nSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this\nhot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot\ncore and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for\nthat are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main\nsubmm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the\nlarge-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the\ncentral protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are\nconsistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude\nthe outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative\ncauses of this velocity pattern.\n"

    "abstract": "  Systems of strongly correlated fermions on certain geometrically frustrated\nlattices at particular filling factors support excitations with fractional\ncharges $\\pm e/2$. We calculate quantum mechanical ground states, low--lying\nexcitations and spectral functions of finite lattices by means of numerical\ndiagonalization. The ground state of the most thoroughfully studied case, the\ncriss-crossed checkerboard lattice, is degenerate and shows long--range order.\nStatic fractional charges are confined by a weak linear force, most probably\nleading to bound states of large spatial extent. Consequently, the\nquasi-particle weight is reduced, which reflects the internal dynamics of the\nfractionally charged excitations. By using an additional parameter, we\nfine--tune the system to a special point at which fractional charges are\nmanifestly deconfined--the so--called Rokhsar--Kivelson point. For a deeper\nunderstanding of the low--energy physics of these models and for numerical\nadvantages, several conserved quantum numbers are identified.\n"

    "abstract": "  This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry,\none-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has\ngenerally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput\ncapacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not\nachievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of \"canonical\nnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities\ncan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the\nthroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper\nbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;\nand simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many\nhops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general\nnetworks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper\nbound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with\nrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far\nbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\nimproved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is\nworthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.\n"

The LC\nmethod yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments were\ndone in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of\nboth self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as\nwell. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. In\nthe temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is\nlarger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that\nthis difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be\nrefered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic\nfactor \\Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for\ninterdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a\ngood approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamic\ncross correlations play a minor role for the temperature range under\nconsideration.\n"

    "abstract": "  The most massive elliptical galaxies show a prominent multi-modality in their\nglobular cluster system color distributions. Understanding the mechanisms which\nlead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a complete\npicture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that globular cluster\nformation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial\nvariations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino &\nMatteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the\ndistribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric\nradius. We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular\nclusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that the\nobserved multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can\nbe, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar\npopulations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population\nof globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very\ngood agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate\nthe impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity\ndistribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of\nmerger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicity\ntransformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model\n(abridged)\n"

    "abstract": "  IGR J11215-5952 is a hard X-ray transient source discovered in April 2005\nwith INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-ray\nBinaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data\nand RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of\n~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic\noutbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of\nOpportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source\nbehaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The\nsource field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th\nFebruary, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,\nduring a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure\nof ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a\nSFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed\npower law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak\nluminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of\nthe optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an\noutburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,\nand they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost\nquiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously\nthought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the\nbrightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly\nincreasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit\nwith many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous\naccretion.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present the first systematic investigation of the [NeV] (14um/24um) and\n[SIII] (18um/33um) infrared line flux ratios, traditionally used to estimate\nthe density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board\nSpitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed\n[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density\nlimit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and\nignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have\nlower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line\nflux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that\ndifferential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in\nthe obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit\nand we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the\ntorus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of\nextinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line\nratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities\nassociated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We\nalso find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended\nand originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from\nlow-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from\nsuch species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby\ngalaxies.\n"

    "abstract": "  We argue that non-Abelian gauge fields can be treated as the pseudo-Goldstone\nvector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To\nthis end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the\nnonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \\boldsymbol{A},_{\\mu\n},\\boldsymbol{A},^{\\mu},)=\\pm M^{2},$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is\nconsidered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\ninvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and\n$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn\nout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.\nHowever, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge\ninvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.\nFor the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could\nbecome directly observable at low energies.\n"

In particular, using a fully covariant\nrelativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\\it\ninelastic}, cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and\ntheir rapidity distributions. However, the $(\\pi^{-},/\\pi^{+},)$- and\n$(K^{0},/K^{+},)$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the\ninelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,\nsince kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon\npotentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative\napproach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results\nshowing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+},$ and $K^{0},$. As a\nconsequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude\nthat particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear\nequation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its\nisovector sector.\n"

The tests involve checking the rate of energy flow out of the MD\nsimulation box; in the equilibrium state, no net rate of flows within\nexperimental error should be observed.

These high-resolution measurements of ground state\nhyperfine splittings will be three orders of magnitude more precise than\nprevious measurements. Moreover, from a comparison of measurements of the\nhyperfine splittings in hydrogen- and lithium-like ions of the same isotope,\nQED effects at high electromagnetic fields can be determined within a few\npercent. Several candidate ions suited for these laser spectroscopy studies are\npresented.\n"

For three or more junctions, symmetry breaking states can be\nachieved without thermal activation, in spite of the fact that the relaxation\ntime is practically constant when the critical temperature is approached from\nabove. The probability for these states decreases with quenching time, but the\ndependence is not allometric. For large number of junctions, cooling does not\nhave to be fast. For this case, we evaluate the standard deviation of the\ninduced flux. Our results are consistent with the available experimental data.\n"

    "abstract": "  It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has been\nexpressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin\nwave function at filling factor $\\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the\nPfaffian wave function at $\\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general\nscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal\nfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic\nvertex operators, $P_{\\frac{1},{m},},(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron\noperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n},(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth},$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and\nquasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and\nstatistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that\ndescribe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general\nclassification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and\n$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a\ngeneral procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other\nfractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling\nfractions not contained in the principal Jain series.\n"

Using a parametric model, we find that almost\nall s-elements were made in a single neutron exposure. This star should be a\nmember of a post-common-envelope binary. After the s-process material has\nexperienced only one neutron exposure in the nucleosynthesis region and is\ndredged-up to its envelope, the AGB evolution is terminated by the onset of\ncommon-envelope evolution. Based on the high radial-velocity of HE 1305-0007,\nwe speculate that the star could be a runaway star from a binary system, in\nwhich the AIC event has occurred and produced the r-process elements.\n"

    "title": "Continuous interfaces with disorder: Even strong pinning is too weak in\n  2 dimensions",
    "abstract": "  We consider statistical mechanics models of continuous height effective\ninterfaces in the presence of a delta-pinning at height zero. There is a\ndetailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions\nwithout disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs\nmeasure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force\nand diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.\n  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify\nthis transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to\nbeat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause\ndelocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap\nbetween local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2\ndimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to\nlocalization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that\nin higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when the\npinning force tends to infinity.\n"

    "abstract": "  The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of\ngrains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,\nobservations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation\nefficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this\ntension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust\nformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first\ntime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to\ntheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.\nWe find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun\nstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between\n2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on\ntime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by\nthe hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller\ngrains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that\nderived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of\nsmall grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports\nthe idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present\nin SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.\n"

    "abstract": "  We analyze 27 house price indexes of Las Vegas from Jun. 1983 to Mar. 2005,\ncorresponding to 27 different zip codes. These analyses confirm the existence\nof a real-estate bubble, defined as a price acceleration faster than\nexponential, which is found however to be confined to a rather limited time\ninterval in the recent past from approximately 2003 to mid-2004 and has\nprogressively transformed into a more normal growth rate comparable to\npre-bubble levels in 2005. There has been no bubble till 2002 except for a\nmedium-sized surge in 1990. In addition, we have identified a strong yearly\nperiodicity which provides a good potential for fine-tuned prediction from\nmonth to month. A monthly monitoring using a model that we have developed could\nconfirm, by testing the intra-year structure, if indeed the market has returned\nto ``normal'' or if more turbulence is expected ahead. We predict the evolution\nof the indexes one year ahead, which is validated with new data up to Sep.\n2006. The present analysis demonstrates the existence of very significant\nvariations at the local scale, in the sense that the bubble in Las Vegas seems\nto have preceded the more global USA bubble and has ended approximately two\nyears earlier (mid 2004 for Las Vegas compared with mid-2006 for the whole of\nthe USA).\n"

Furthermore their evolution is\nconditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the\nstructural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen\nin a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise\naffected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility\nof emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to\ndifferent inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas\n(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending\non the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is\nconsidered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local\nand global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly\nadapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis\nshows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply\nphysical sense- the term gas here used.\n"

Performing a numerical solution we confirm the earlier result\nof [hep-ph/0408216] that the high energy evolution with the running coupling\nleads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The\nrunning coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape\nof the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a\nconsiderable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the\nevolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is\ndue to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the\nsubtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.\nThese subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate\nnumerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that\nwhen the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in\nthe two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then\nuse the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find\nthe numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with\nthe running coupling corrections. Again the scaling regime is recovered at very\nlarge rapidity.\n"

Gas and dust\nproperties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent\ndisk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved\nboth in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar\nmaterial is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk\ninclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position\nangle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7\nmm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.\nThe dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200\nAU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and\nCO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,\nwe obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.\nWe argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is\nstrongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of\ndust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of\nlarge bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the\ndust distribution by a low mass companion.\n"

In the network, the local magnetic topology\nis more important in determining the shapes of the Stokes V profiles than the\nphase of the wave, contrary to what our simulations show. We also find that\nStokes V asymmetries are very common in the network, and the histograms of the\nobserved amplitude and area asymmetries differ significantly from the\nsimulation. Both the network and internetwork show oscillatory behavior in the\nCa II lines.

We\nanalyze the search reach of the CMS experiment for the heavy neutral MSSM Higgs\nbosons with an integrated luminosity of 30 or 60 fb^-1. This is done by\ncombining the latest results for the CMS experimental sensitivities based on\nfull simulation studies with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSM\nHiggs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios\nin terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We\nstudy the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta\nplane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects\narise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via\nhigher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into\nsupersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\\mu$ can shift the\nprospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by\nabout Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable\nwith respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the\ndiscovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy\nneutral Higgs bosons can be determined. We find that an accuracy of 1-4% should\nbe achievable, which could make it possible in favourable regions of the MSSM\nparameter space to experimentally resolve the signals of the two heavy MSSM\nHiggs bosons at the LHC.\n"

Denoting by M_4 the space of\nmoduli of smooth curves of genus 4, the moduli map of W is the rational map\nfrom W to M_4 sending the general point of W, corresponding to a plane curve D,\nto the point of M_4 parametrizing the normalization curve of D. The number of\nmoduli of W is, by definition the dimension of the image of W with respect to\nthe moduli map. We know that this number is at most equal to seven.

    "abstract": "  The temporal evolution of step-edge fluctuations under electromigration\nconditions is analysed using a continuum Langevin model. If the\nelectromigration driving force acts in the step up/down direction, and\nstep-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find that\nsignificant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4},$ scaling of the terrace-width\ncorrelation function occurs for a critical time $\\tau$ which is dependent upon\nthe three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B},T$, the step stiffness, $\\gamma$,\nand the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an\nelectromigration force, $\\pm \\Delta U$. For ($t < \\tau$), the correlation\nfunction evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4},$ and $t^{3/4},$ power laws. For\n$t \\ge \\tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is\nconfirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step\ndynamics. It is proposed that the magnitude of the electromigration force\nacting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis of\nthe statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriate\ntime-scale.\n"

    "abstract": "  Using local morphological measures on the sphere defined through a steerable\nwavelet analysis, we examine the three-year WMAP and the NVSS data for\ncorrelation induced by the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The steerable\nwavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to\ndefine three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,\norientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between\nthe WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The\nmost significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the\nsigned-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting\nsigned-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the\ncorrelation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination and\ninstrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all\nsignificant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the\nISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced\nbetween the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the\nUniverse. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, our\ndetection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for\ndark energy. Moreover, this new morphological analysis may be used in future to\nhelp us to better understand the nature of dark energy.\n"

    "abstract": "  In the coming decades, research in extrasolar planets aims to advance two\ngoals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar to\nthe Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present a\nnew planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards\nboth of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is\nable to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet\ntransits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time\nbetween transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer\nthe orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass\nthat is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique\ncomplements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion\nresonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced\nsensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the\nphotometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV\nplanet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of\nhigh-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing\ntelescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting\nplanets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.\nA relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\\sim 0.5\n{\\rm m},$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically\nincrease the effectiveness of transit timing observations.\n"

Motivated by the elastic network model,\nproteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volume\ndefined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Element\nrepresentation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm that\nfacilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatial\nresolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of\nT4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler\nbuckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare\nfavorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks\nprocedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational\nframework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates\nthe incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model,\nincluding aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is\nequally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to\nelectron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular\nassemblies of unknown atomic structure.\n"

For the analysis we create different\nsynthetic loops and we place them on real backgrounds from data obtained with\nthe Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (\\textit{TRACE},). We apply to these\nloops the same procedure followed in our previous works, and we compare the\nresults with real loop observations. We demonstrate that the procedure allows\nus to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably with\nheight, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even for\nloops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops\nare below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that\nsmall-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to\nimperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in\nespecially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright\nrelative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact the\nability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops do\nnot expand systematically with height is robust.\n"

    "abstract": "  We describe results of a narrow band search for ultra-strong emission line\ngalaxies (USELs) with EW(H beta) > 30 A. 542 candidate galaxies are found in a\nhalf square degree survey using two ~100 Angstrom 8150 A and 9140 A filters\nwith Subaru/SuprimeCam. Followup spectroscopy for randomly selected objects in\nthe sample with KeckII/DEIMOS shows they consist of [OIII] 5007, [OII] 3727,\nand H alpha selected strong-emission line galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z\n< 1), and Ly alpha emitting galaxies at high-redshift (z >> 5). We determine\nthe H beta luminosity functions and the star formation density of the USELs,\nwhich is 5-10% of the value found from ultraviolet continuum objects at z=0-1,\nsuggesting they correspond to a major epoch in galaxy formation at these\nredshifts. Many USELs show the temperature-sensitive [OIII] 4363 auroral lines\nand about a dozen have oxygen abundances characteristic of eXtremely Metal Poor\nGalaxies (XMPGs). These XMPGs are the most distant known today. Our high yield\nrate of XMPGs suggests this is a powerful method for finding such populations.\nThe lowest metallicity measured in our sample is 12+log(O/H) = 7.06\n(6.78-7.44), close to the minimum metallicity found in local galaxies. The\nluminosities, metallicities and star formation rates of USELs are consistent\nwith the strong emitters being start-up intermediate mass galaxies and suggest\nthat galaxies are still forming in relatively chemically pristine sites at z <\n1.\n"

The most remarkable\nproperty of the HD 15115 disk relative to other debris disks is its extreme\nlength asymmetry. The east side of the disk is detected to ~315 AU radius,\nwhereas the west side of the disk has radius >550 AU.

The existence of a\nlarge debris disk surrounding HD 15115 adds further evidence for membership in\nthe Beta Pic moving group, which was previously argued based on kinematics\nalone. Here we hypothesize that the extreme disk asymmetry is due to dynamical\nperturbations from HIP 12545, an M star 0.5 degrees (0.38 pc) east of HD 15115\nthat shares a common proper motion vector, heliocentric distance, galactic\nspace velocity, and age.\n"

At present all\nknown string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level\nof detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may\npresent a challenge to string cosmology.\n  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation\nthat in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the\nHubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For\nthe gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2}, < O(1) TeV, this leads to an\nextremely strong bound r < 10^{-24},. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r\n> 10^{-3}, would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are\nsuperheavy, m_{3/2}, > 10^{13}, GeV.

    "abstract": "  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a\nbehavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a\ndirected multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.\nIt has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is\nmanifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that\ncircuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients\nof the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those\ncoefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral\ndynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been\nstudied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.\nThe neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of\nexisting memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in\nclassical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has\nbeen introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and\nproduces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even\nbe impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible\nexplanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain\nhas been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential\nbehavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance\nto hemodynamics has been outlined.\n"

    "abstract": "  We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths\nof supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming\ngalaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)\nabsorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1},$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can\nproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude\nthat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.\n"

The catalog covers SDSS\nStripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz\nsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. In each photometric bandpass we\ncompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select and\nstudy variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter\nthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g\nand r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)\nquasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted\nflux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the\n0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for\nfinding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high\nGalactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for\nquasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of the\nvariable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main\nstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of\nlightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar\nlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like\nbehavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo\nsubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to\nexpected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that\nit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 million\nlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.\n"

    "abstract": "  The boundary conditions of the heliosphere are set by the ionization, density\nand composition of inflowing interstellar matter. Constraining the properties\nof the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) at the heliosphere requires radiative\ntransfer ionization models. We model the background interstellar radiation\nfield using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray\nbackground. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and\nthe hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating\nbecause of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible\nrange of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to\nradiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data\nfrom in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the\nheliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to\nconstrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column\ndensities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the\nobservational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)\nand T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron\ndensity in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-\n0.01 cm^-3. Derived abundances are mostly typical for low density gas, with\nsub-solar Mg, Si and Fe, possibly subsolar O and N, and S about solar; however\nC is supersolar. The interstellar gas at the Sun is warm, low density, and\npartially ionized, with n(H) = 0.23 - 0.27 cm^-3, T = 6300 K, X(H^+) ~ 0.2, and\nX(He^+) ~ 0.4. These results appear to be robust since acceptable models are\nfound for substantially different input radiation fields. Our results favor low\nvalues for the reference solar abundances for the LIC composition.\n"

    "abstract": "  The observed association of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) with peculiar Type\nIc supernovae gives support to Woosley`s collapsar/hypernova model, in which\nthe GRB is produced by the collapse of the rapidly rotating core of a massive\nstar to a black hole. The association of LGRBs with small star-forming galaxies\nsuggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to the\ncollapsar stage. Both completely-mixed single star models and binary star\nmodels are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massive\nhelium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization during\ncore-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a few\nmillennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequent\nevolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence\ncompanions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium stars\nin close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite the\nstrong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retain\nsufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.\n"

    "title": "Multiscale model of electronic behavior and localization in stretched\n  dry DNA",
    "abstract": "  When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretch\nelastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. These\ndistortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic\neffect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport\nalong DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the\nelectronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we\nbegin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic\nstates in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations\nencountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are\ncomplemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states\nof a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,\nusing previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic\nstates are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can\ndescribe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the\npresence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the\nsubstrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which\nleads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several\norders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched\nstructure.\n"

    "abstract": "  Any color singlet or octet ccbar pair is created at short distances and then\nexpands to a full size of J/psi. Such a dynamical evolution process is included\nhere in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of\ntransverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and\nLHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the\npartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic\nchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1},L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1},L_J]x, and then they\ndissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs\nvia two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet\nccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are\nmodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the\nreactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1},L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average\nmomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal\nstage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the\nsuppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a\nbulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution and\nthe ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus an\nindicator of a deconfined partonic medium. Based on this result we suggest the\nrapidity region worth measuring in future experiments at RHIC and LHC to be\n-3<y<3.\n"

We consider the setting in which one has perfect observation of the\n$X$-part of the sample, while the $Y$-part has to be communicated at some\nfinite bit rate.

Under suitable regularity conditions on the admissible predictors,\nthe underlying family of probability distributions and the loss function, we\ngive an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictor\nperformance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions. The ideas are\nillustrated on the example of nonparametric regression in Gaussian noise.\n"

This Hamiltonian system containing\n1 degree of freedom and without constraint, gives Friedmann equations as the\nequation of motion, which describes a mechanical system with a variable mass\nobject moving in a potential field. After an appropriate transformation of the\nscale factor, this system can be further simplified to an object with constant\nmass moving in an effective potential field. In this framework, the $\\Lambda$\ncold dark matter model as the current standard model of cosmology corresponds\nto a harmonic oscillator. We further generalize this formalism to take into\naccount the bulk viscosity and other cases.

    "abstract": "  Suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) is a form of noise enhanced signal\ntransmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical\nthreshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms of\nstochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input\nsignals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small\namounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR\nin the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between\nShannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for\noptimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is\nachieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the\nnoise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal\ndistribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical\nverification and justification for previous work in both computational\nneuroscience and electronics.\n"

The orientations of blue satellites, however, are\nperfectly consistent with being isotropic.

The high spatial resolution of the MSX\nobservations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the\nsky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches\nwell the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path\nacross the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest\nregion of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.\n  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway\nstars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A\nrunaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with\nour results.\n"

    "abstract": "  Every finite branch solutions to the sixth Painleve equation around a fixed\nsingular point is an algebraic branch solution. In particular a global solution\nis an algebraic solution if and only if it is finitely many-valued globally.\nThe proof of this result relies on algebraic geometry of Painleve VI,\nRiemann-Hilbert correspondence, geometry and dynamics on cubic surfaces,\nresolutions of Kleinian singularities, and power geometry of algebraic\ndifferential equations. In the course of the proof we are also able to classify\nall finite branch solutions up to Backlund transformations.\n"

The SiO maser emission\noccurs at a few stellar radii from the central star, providing direct\ninformation on the stellar pulsation and on the chemical and physical\nproperties of these regions. Our data also shed light on several aspects of the\nSiO maser pumping theory that are not well understood yet. We aim to determine},\nthe relative spatial distribution of the 43 GHz and 86 GHz SiO maser lines in\nthe oxygen-rich evolved star R Leo. We have imaged with milliarcsecond\nresolution, by means of Very Long Baseline Interferometry, the 43 GHz (28SiO\nv=1, 2 J=1-0 and 29SiO v=0 J=1-0) and 86 GHz (28SiO v=1 J=2-1 and 29SiO v=0\nJ=2-1) masing regions. We confirm previous results obtained in other\noxygen-rich envelopes. In particular, when comparing the 43 GHz emitting\nregions, the 28SiO v=2 transition is produced in an inner layer, closer to the\ncentral star. On the other hand, the 86 GHz line arises in a clearly farther\nshell. We have also mapped for the first time the 29SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission in R\nLeo. The already reported discrepancy between the observed distributions of the\ndifferent maser lines and the theoretical predictions is also found in R Leo.\n"

This unexpected phenomenon is explained by\nthe analysis of the spin-wave spectrum. We demonstrate that the square of the\nspin-wave gap becomes negative under magnetic field applied along $<111>$ and\n$<110>$ but not along the $<100>$ direction. It is a result of competition\nbetween the spin-wave interaction and cubic anisotropy.

In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the\nweighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of\nthe connections.

We prove\nthat the asymptotic shape of this model is a Euclidean ball, in a sense which\nis stronger than our earlier work. For the shape consisting of $n=\\omega_d r^d$\nsites, where $\\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\\R^d$, we show that\nthe inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\\log r)$, while the\noutradius is at most $r+O(r^\\alpha)$ for any $\\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a related\nmodel, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is a\nEuclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the total\nmass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\\pi\nr^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\\sqrt{3},$, and the\noutradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\\sqrt{2},$. This improves on bounds of Le Borgne\nand Rossin. Similar bounds apply in higher dimensions.\n"

The piston\nseparates two gas chambers, each of which contains finitely many ideal, unit\nmass gas particles moving in $d$ dimensions, where $ d\\geq 1$. Using averaging\ntechniques, we prove that the actual motions of the piston converge in\nprobability to the predicted averaged behavior on the time scale $M^ {1/2}, $\nwhen $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded and\nthe number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed\nout that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.\n  When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that\nthe rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged\nbehavior is $\\mathcal{O}, (M^ {-1/2},) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2}, $. The\nconvergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also\ninvestigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been\nsmoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly,\nboth over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.\n  In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons\nseparating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of\naveraging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averaging\nresults. In particular, we include a new proof of Anosov's averaging theorem\nfor smooth systems that is primarily due to Dolgopyat.\n"

A biradical mechanism has been envisaged for each\ncycloalkane, and the main routes for the decomposition of the biradicals formed\nhave been investigated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Thermochemical data\n(\\delta H^0_f, S^0, C^0_p) for all the involved species have been obtained by\nmeans of isodesmic reactions. The contribution of hindered rotors has also been\nincluded. Activation barriers of each reaction have been analyzed to assess the\n1 energetically most favorable pathways for the decomposition of biradicals.\nRate constants have been derived for all elementary reactions using transition\nstate theory at 1 atm and temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000 K. Global rate\nconstant for the decomposition of the cyclic alkanes in molecular products have\nbeen calculated. Comparison between calculated and experimental results allowed\nto validate the theoretical approach. An important result is that the\nrotational barriers between the conformers, which are usually neglected, are of\nimportance in decomposition rate of the largest biradicals. Ring strain\nenergies (RSE) in transition states for ring opening have been estimated and\nshow that the main part of RSE contained in the cyclic reactants is removed\nupon the activation process.\n"

After a presentation of some general properties of\nYb-doped materials, we address the issue of evaluating the temperature map in\nYb-doped laser crystals, both theoretically and experimentally. This is the\nfirst step before studying the complex problem of thermal lensing (part III).\nWe will focus on some newly discussed aspects, like the definition of the\nthermo-optic coefficient: we will highlight some misleading interpretations of\nthermal lensing experiments due to the use of the dn/dT parameter in a context\nwhere it is not relevant. Part IV will be devoted to a state-of-the-art of\nexperimental techniques used to measure thermal lensing.

It is\nshown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent\nto replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic\nexpression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well\nthe asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient\nsurface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this\nmodel and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient\n\"near-zone\" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally,\nit is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes\nthe asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient\nnear-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and\noptimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part\nwill be controlled by surface waves.\n"

Glauber calculations, for example,\ntypically adopt the first-order eikonal approximation. We present an extension\nof the relativistic eikonal approach to $A(e,e'p)$ which accounts for\nsecond-order eikonal corrections. The numerical calculations are performed\nwithin the relativistic optical model eikonal approximation. The nuclear\ntransparency results indicate that the effect of the second-order eikonal\ncorrections is rather modest, even at $Q^{2}, \\approx 0.2$ (GeV/c)$^2$. The same\napplies to polarization observables, left-right asymmetries, and differential\ncross sections at low missing momenta. At high missing momenta, however, the\nsecond-order eikonal corrections are significant and bring the calculations in\ncloser agreement with the data and/or the exact results from models adopting\npartial-wave expansions.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present a serendipitous detection of the infrared-bright supernova remnant\n(SNR) B0104-72.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud by the Infrared Camera (IRC)\nonboard AKARI. An elongated, partially complete shell is detected in all four\nobserved IRC bands covering 2.6-15 um. The infrared shell surrounds radio,\noptical, and X-ray emission associated with the SNR and is probably a radiative\nSNR shell. This is the first detection of a SNR shell in this near/mid-infrared\nwaveband in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The IRC color indicates that the\ninfrared emission might be from shocked H2 molecules with some possible\ncontributions from ionic lines. We conclude that B0104-72.3 is a middle-aged\nSNR interacting with molecular clouds, similar to the Galactic SNR IC 443. Our\nresults highlight the potential of AKARI IRC observations in studying SNRs,\nespecially for diagnosing SNR shocks.\n"

    "title": "Flavor Composition and Energy Spectrum of Astrophysical Neutrinos",
    "abstract": "  The measurement of the flavor composition of the neutrino fluxes from\nastrophysical sources has been proposed as a method to study not only the\nnature of their emission mechanisms, but also the neutrino fundamental\nproperties. It is however problematic to reconcile these two goals, since a\nsufficiently accurate understanding of the neutrino fluxes at the source is\nneeded to extract information about the physics of neutrino propagation. In\nthis work we discuss critically the expectations for the flavor composition and\nenergy spectrum from different types of astrophysical sources, and comment on\nthe theoretical uncertainties connected to our limited knowledge of their\nstructure.\n"

    "title": "Gravitational Wave Signals from Chaotic System: A Point Mass with A Disk",
    "abstract": "  We study gravitational waves from a particle moving around a system of a\npoint mass with a disk in Newtonian gravitational theory. A particle motion in\nthis system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface\ndensity of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,\nwe sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle\nmotion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a\nfinite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these\ndifferent chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we\ninvestigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that\nsuch a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy\nspectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different\nfrom that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This\nsuggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of\nthe orbit via the gravitational waves.\n"

    "title": "Timing evidence in determining the accretion state of the Seyfert galaxy\n  NGC 3783",
    "abstract": "  Previous observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) have\nsuggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope\nnear zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black\nhole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux\nemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state\ninterpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is\nsimilar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at\nwhich the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between\n`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does\nhave a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN\nand GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an\nimproved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8}, to ~10^{-3}, Hz, based on\nconsiderably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of\ncontinuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well\nfitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.\nAlthough a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by\nadding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not\nunusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second\nbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate\nimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found\nin NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other\nAGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.\n"

For the boosted black string, this effective tension is always\npositive, while the ADM tension is negative for large boost parameter. We also\nderive two Smarr formulas, one that follows from time translation invariance,\nand a second one that holds only in the case of exact translation symmetry in\nthe compact dimension.

    "abstract": "  The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links\nmakes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to\nkeep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.\nSampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by\nthe collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating\nflow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all\ncases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a\nper-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the\ncollected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant\nfor some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.\nHowever, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative\naccuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of\nsampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the\noriginal traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the\nimpact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.\nIn this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in\nNetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss\nof monitoring detail.\n"

We analyze the impact of the tensor terms on a large\nvariety of observables in spherical mean-field calculations, such as the\nspin-orbit splittings and single-particle spectra of doubly-magic nuclei, the\nevolution of spin-orbit splittings along chains of semi-magic nuclei, mass\nresiduals of spherical nuclei, and known anomalies of charge radii.

The observed SEDs are\nmodeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using\nthe phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated\nwith passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red\nquasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are\nused to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black\nholes residing in these AGN.\n  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)\nbands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed\nnear- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the\nrange ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is\n~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al.

Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real\nHaar MRA.

This fact implies that there exist infinity many different\n2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\\cL},^2(\\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar\nMRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential\noperators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be\nintensively used for applications.\n"

    "abstract": "  Activated dynamics in a glassy system undergoing steady shear deformation is\nstudied by numerical simulations. Our results show that the external driving\nforce has a strong influence on the barrier crossing rate, even though the\nreaction coordinate is only weakly coupled to the nonequilibrium system. This\n\"driven activation\" can be quantified by introducing in the Arrhenius\nexpression an effective temperature, which is close to the one determined from\nthe fluctuation-dissipation relation. This conclusion is supported by\nanalytical results for a simplified model system.\n"

We consider models with the same circular\nvelocity in the equatorial plane (purely baryonic disks in MOND and the same\ndisks in Newtonian gravity embedded in spherical dark matter haloes), and we\nconstruct their intrinsic and projected kinematical fields by solving the Jeans\nequations under the assumption of a two-integral distribution function. We\nfound that the vertical velocity dispersion of deep-MOND disks can be much\nlarger than in the equivalent spherical Newtonian models. However, in the more\nrealistic case of high-surface density disks this effect is significantly\nreduced, casting doubts on the possibility of discriminating between MOND and\nNewtonian gravity with dark matter by using current observations.\n"

    "abstract": "  The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results in\ncomplex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,\nfamilies, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent\nchanges in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the\nassociated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution.\nOur knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is\nlimited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and\nself-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm\nbased on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate\nthe time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to\nuncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on\nnetworks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between\nmobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are\ncapable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to\nchange the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small\ngroups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that\ntheir composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the\ntime commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating\nthe community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental\ndifferences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.\n"

    "abstract": "  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled\nstate, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well\ndefined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is\nindependent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled\nphotons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or\nmechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.\n"

We phrase the energy spectrum in terms of the\nLittlewood-Paley decomposition and show that the energy flux is controlled by\nlocal interactions.

    "title": "Failure of the work-Hamiltonian connection for free energy calculations",
    "abstract": "  Extensions of statistical mechanics are routinely being used to infer free\nenergies from the work performed over single-molecule nonequilibrium\ntrajectories. A key element of this approach is the ubiquitous expression\ndW/dt=\\partial H(x,t)/ \\partial t which connects the microscopic work W\nperformed by a time-dependent force on the coordinate x with the corresponding\nHamiltonian H(x,t) at time t. Here we show that this connection, as pivotal as\nit is, cannot be used to estimate free energy changes. We discuss the\nimplications of this result for single-molecule experiments and atomistic\nmolecular simulations and point out possible avenues to overcome these\nlimitations.\n"

The\ncoupling between internal and external degrees of freedom, due to the\nmechanical effect on the atom from photon emission into the cavity mode, can\ndramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general the\ntunneling process becomes quasiperiodic. In a certain regime of parameters a\ncollapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees of\nfreedom of the atom with a laser allows to coherently manipulate the atom\nposition, and in particular to prepare the atom in one of the two wells.

After reviewing various meanings of the term\n``nonlocal'', we show that by using appropriately retarded wavefunctions (i.e.,\nthe locality loophole) this local model can violate Bell's inequality, without\nmaking any appeal to detector inefficiencies.\n  We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massive\ntwo-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles are\nnot ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) can\npropagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the\nother detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local\ninterpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories.\n  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in a\nStern-Gerlach EPR setup that will throw away events and create a detector\nloophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is only\nsignificant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the locality\nloophole.\n"

    "abstract": "  NGC 7679 is a nearby luminous infrared Sy2 galaxy in which starburst and AGN\nactivities co-exist. The ionization structure is maintained by both the AGN\npower-law continuum and starburst. The galaxy is a bright X-ray source\npossessing a low X-ray column density N_H < 4 x 10^20 cm^{-2},. The Compton-thin\nnature of such unabsorbed objects infers that the simple formulation of the\nUnified model for SyGs is not applicable in their case. The main goal of this\narticle is to investigate both gas distribution and ionization structure in the\ncircumnuclear region of NGC 7679 in search for the presence of a hidden Sy1\nnucleus, using the [O III] 5007 luminosity as a tracer of AGN activity. The [O\nIII] 5007 image of the NGC 7679 shows elliptical isophotes extended along the\nPA ~ 80 deg in the direction to the counterpart galaxy NGC 7682. The maximum of\nionization by the AGN power-law continuum traced by [O III] 5007/Halpha ratio\nis displaced by ~ 13 arcsec eastward from the nucleus. We conclude that the\ndust and gas in the high ionization direction has a direct view to the central\nAGN engine. This possibly results in dust/star-formation decay. A large\nfraction of the unabsorbed Compton-thin Sy2s with [O III] luminosity > 10^41\nerg s^{-1}, possesses a hidden AGN source (abridged).\n"

    "abstract": "  To investigate the universality of the structure of interactions in different\nmarkets, we analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of stock price fluctuations\nin the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. We find that this emerging\nmarket exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to\ndeveloped markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to\nbe due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.\nBy comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to\nthe same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector\nidentity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network\nof mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,\nthe few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by\nrandom matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.\nWe show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions\nbetween stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics\nwith a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal\nstructure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a\nsignature of market development.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present a morphological study of galaxies in the A901/902 supercluster\nfrom the COMBO-17 survey. A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts in\nthe range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independent\nclassifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to\nlocal galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface\nmass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local\ngalaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density\nrelation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local\nprojected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the\nnearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more\nimportant to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of\nthe morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the\ngalaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red\ngalaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from\nCOMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive\ngalaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription\nof Wolf et al. (2005). We find that the dusty star-forming population describes\nan intermediate morphological group between late-type and early-type galaxies,\nsupporting the hypothesis that field and group spiral galaxies are transformed\ninto S0s and, perhaps, ellipticals during cluster infall.\n"

A large sub-barrier fusion\nenhancement was observed. Coupled-channel calculations including inelastic\nexcitation of the projectile and target, and neutron transfer are in good\nagreement with the measured fusion excitation function.

    "abstract": "  Various methods of treating outer boundaries in numerical relativity are\ncompared using a simple test problem: a Schwarzschild black hole with an\noutgoing gravitational wave perturbation. Numerical solutions computed using\ndifferent boundary treatments are compared to a `reference' numerical solution\nobtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For each\nboundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations and\nextracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution,\nthereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. These\ntests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein\nequations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system are\nreviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is\npresented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing the\nincoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the\nconstraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather\ndifferent approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial\ncompactification, are also tested. Overall the best treatment found here\ncombines boundary conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze the\nNewman-Penrose scalar Psi_0, and control gauge reflections.\n"

We use the catalog to search for magnetic white dwarfs in\ncataclysmic variable progenitor systems. Given that approximately 25% of\ncataclysmic variables contain a magnetic white dwarf, and that our large sample\nof close binary systems should contain many progenitors of cataclysmic\nvariables, it is quite surprising that we find only two potential magnetic\nwhite dwarfs in this sample. The candidate magnetic white dwarfs, if confirmed,\nwould possess relatively low magnetic field strengths (B_WD < 10 MG) that are\nsimilar to those of intermediate-Polars but are much less than the average\nfield strength of the current Polar population. Additional observations of\nthese systems are required to definitively cast the white dwarfs as magnetic.\nEven if these two systems prove to be the first evidence of detached magnetic\nwhite dwarf + M dwarf binaries, there is still a large disparity between the\nproperties of the presently known cataclysmic variable population and the\npresumed close binary progenitors.\n"

As\nhigh uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful\nanalysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2\nparameters) and cut--off power law (CPL, 3 parameters) models to the\ntime-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the corresponding\nparameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties.\nThe CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nu\npeak energy Epk. For these GRBs, we calculate the energy fluence and the rest-\nframe isotropic-equivalent radiated energy, Eiso, as well as the propagated\nuncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of our\nhomogeneous sample of GRBs on the rest-frame diagram E'pk vs Eiso. We confirm a\nsignificant correlation between these two quantities (the \"Amati\" relation) and\nwe verify that, within the uncertainty limits, no outliers are present. We also\nfit the spectra to a Band model with the high energy power law index frozen to\n-2.3, obtaining a rather good agreement with the \"Amati\" relation of non-Swift\nGRBs.\n"

    "abstract": "  We provide a model for how Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws, which describe the\ncorrelation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density,\ndepend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for lines\nthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line\ncritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming\nmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar\nphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation\nbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines\nprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star\nformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a\nsimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous\ncan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic\nluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and\nnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict\nthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which\nthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may\nbe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate\ncritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high\nredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.\nhint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity in\nthe HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with the\nassumption of a constant star formation efficiency.\n"

    "abstract": "  We introduce a density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, that\nrecovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density\nmatrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability\ndistribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure\nstate density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple\ngenerating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a\nquantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,\nthe corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products\nof system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of\nthe quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit\ntrace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent\nrelations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under\ncontraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.\nAs examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we\nconsider a quantum system evolving by It\\^o stochastic and by jump process\nSchr\\\"odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace\nformalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian\nmotion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov\nmaster equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies\ngeneralizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett\nmaster equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast\nstochastic Schr\\\"odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state\nvector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment\nbehaves like the latter.\n"

Here we\ngive a simple proof of those overlooked results.\n  Secondly, we fill in a gap in the proof of the 2002 paper. There it was\nclaimed that an axial map f must satisfy f^*(X)=X_1+X_2. We realized recently\nthat this is not clear. However, here we show that it is true up multiplication\nby a unit in the appropriate ring, and so we retrieve all the nonimmersion\nresults claimed in the original paper.\n  Finally, we present a complete determination of tmf^{8*},(RP^\\infty\\times\nRP^\\infty) and tmf^*(CP^\\infty\\times CP^\\infty) in positive dimensions.\n"

    "title": "Spin Evolution of Accreting Neutron Stars: Nonlinear Development of the\n  R-mode Instability",
    "abstract": "  The nonlinear saturation of the r-mode instability and its effects on the\nspin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet\nof modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically\nthe coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the\nspin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode\namplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,\nthe mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is\nreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.\nEventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a\ncyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a\nfull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational\nradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long\ntimescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway\n(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are\nshear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary\nproprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature\nT_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA\nreactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to\nranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude\nremains small $\\sim 10^{-5},$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer\nviscosity to $\\nu_{max}, \\sim 800 Hz [S_{ns},/(M_{1.4}, R_6)]^{4/11}, T_8^{-2/11},$.\nWe find that for $\\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for\nabout 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the\nlocal group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present a quantum auction protocol using superpositions to represent bids\nand distributed search to identify the winner(s). Measuring the final quantum\nstate gives the auction outcome while simultaneously destroying the\nsuperposition. Thus non-winning bids are never revealed. Participants can use\nentanglement to arrange for correlations among their bids, with the assurance\nthat this entanglement is not observable by others. The protocol is useful for\ninformation hiding applications, such as partnership bidding with allocative\nexternality or concerns about revealing bidding preferences. The protocol\napplies to a variety of auction types, e.g., first or second price, and to\nauctions involving either a single item or arbitrary bundles of items (i.e.,\ncombinatorial auctions). We analyze the game-theoretical behavior of the\nquantum protocol for the simple case of a sealed-bid quantum, and show how a\nsuitably designed adiabatic search reduces the possibilities for bidders to\ngame the auction. This design illustrates how incentive rather that\ncomputational constraints affect quantum algorithm choices.\n"

    "title": "Opportunistic Relay Selection with Limited Feedback",
    "abstract": "  It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on\nopportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in\ndense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ\ntransmission approach where relays forward parity information to the\ndestination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however,\nsuffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the\nbest channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by\nadding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection\nproblem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is\nnecessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying\nkey parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold\nis discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the\nimportance of relay selection.\n"

The\nquasar redshifts range from 0.08 to 5.41, with a median value of 1.48; the\ncatalog includes 891 quasars at redshifts greater than four, of which 36 are at\nredshifts greater than five. Approximately half of the catalog quasars have i <\n19; nearly all have i < 21. For each object the catalog presents positions\naccurate to better than 0.2 arcsec. rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz)\nCCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the\nmorphology and selection method. The catalog also contains basic radio,\nnear-infrared, and X-ray emission properties of the quasars, when available,\nfrom other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the\nwavelength region 3800--9200A at a spectral resolution of ~2000.

The stars have spectral types between F6 and M5.5 (B-V between\n0.457 and 1.807) and metallicity between [Fe/H] = -0.82 and 0.6. We obtained\nmedium resolution echelle spectra using the 2.15-m telescope at the argentinian\nobservatory CASLEO. The observations have been performed periodically since\n1999. The spectra were calibrated in wavelength and in flux. A definition of\nthe pseudo-continuum level is found for all our observations. We also define a\ncontinuum level for calibration purposes. The equivalent width of the D lines\nis computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V)\nof the stars. When possible, we perform a careful comparison with previous\nstudies. Finally, we construct a spectral index (R_D') as the ratio between the\nflux in the D lines, and the bolometric flux. We find that, once corrected for\nthe photospheric contribution, this index can be used as a chromospheric\nactivity indicator in stars with a high level of activity.

In particular, we study powerful Poynting flux\ndominated jets that are driven from dense gas in the equatorial plane in the\nergosphere. The physics of which has been previously studied in the simplified\nlimit of an ergopsheric disk. For high spin black holes, $a/M > 0.95$, the\nergospheric disk is prominent in the 3-D simulations and is responsible for\ngreatly enhanced Poynting flux emission. Any large scale poloidal magnetic flux\nthat is trapped in the equatorial region leads to an enormous release of\nelectromagnetic energy that dwarfs the jet energy produced by magnetic flux\nthreading the event horizon. The implication is that magnetic flux threading\nthe equatorial plane of the ergosphere is a likely prerequisite for the central\nengine of powerful FRII quasars.\n"

    "abstract": "  Particle in cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are\npresented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops a\ndistinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. The length of the\nelectron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass,\napproaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. A surprise,\nhowever, is that the electrons form a high-velocity outflow jet that remains\ndecoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from\nthe x-line. The rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems,\nindependent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons.\n"

    "abstract": "  We have studied the maser emission from a thin, planar, gaseous ring in\nKeplerian rotation around a central mass observed edge-on. The absorption\ncoefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence with\nthe distance from the central mass as, k=k0r^{-q},. We have calculated\nposition-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for different\nvalues of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q,\nthese diagrams can be qualitatively different. The most intense maser emission\nat a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner or\nouter edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the line\nof sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed).\nParticularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similar\nto the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxy\nNGC 4258. In the context of this simple model, we conclude that in this object\nthe absorption coefficient depends on the radius of the amplifying ring as a\ndecreasing function, in order to have significant emission coming from the\ninner edge of the ring.\n"

For spin 3/2 we find that the most natural phase has spins\norganized into parallel ladders. As a by-product, we also write a Landau theory\nof the ordering in two special classical frustrated XY models on the cubic\nlattice, one of which is the fully frustrated XY model.

Although the feature is relatively shallow (tau_{9.7}, =\n0.08-0.09), it is about 2 times deeper than expected from extrapolation of the\ntau_{9.7}, vs. E(B-V) relation known for diffuse Galactic interstellar clouds.\nFurther studies of the 9.7 micrometer silicate feature in quasar absorbers will\nopen a new window on the dust in distant galaxies.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present wide-field BVI photometry for about 11,500 stars in the\nlow-metallicity cluster NGC 5466. We have detected the red giant branch bump\nfor the first time, although it is at least 0.2 mag fainter than expected\nrelative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequence\nturnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the\nYonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina\nmodels. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to\nmain-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity. We discuss\ntheoretical predictions from different research groups and find that the\ninclusion or exclusion of helium diffusion and strong limit Coulomb\ninteractions may be partly responsible.\n  We also examine indicators of dynamical history: the mass function exponent\nand the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,\nconsistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue\nstraggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or\nRGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at\nlarge distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate that\nthe stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present density\nstructure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusually\nlow central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite of\nthis, the specific frequency of blue stragglers that puts it right on the\nfrequency -- cluster M_V relation observed for other clusters.\n"

    "abstract": "  Using numerical simulations, we investigate vortex configurations and pinning\nin superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We find that a\nvariety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer and\nfractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays\nproduce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical\ndepinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks\nat noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in\nthe large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb\npinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings\nB/B_\\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent\nexperiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally\noccur at B/B_\\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced\nmatching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\\phi=n. At the\nnoninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the\ninterstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer\nstates that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states\n\"vortex molecular crystals\" and \"vortex plastic crystals\" since they are\nsimilar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.\nWe argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with\ncertain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show that\nkagome and honeycomb pinning arrays can be useful for increasing the critical\ncurrent above that of purely triangular pinning arrays.\n"

    "abstract": "  We study universal compression of sequences generated by monotonic\ndistributions. We show that for a monotonic distribution over an alphabet of\nsize $k$, each probability parameter costs essentially $0.5 \\log (n/k^3)$ bits,\nwhere $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3},)$. Otherwise,\nfor $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\\epsilon},)$\nbits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic\ndistributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of\n$O(n^{1/3+\\epsilon},)$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains\nfast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and\ngeometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions\nover the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a\nmethod to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived.\nThe results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.\nFinally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence\nis governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose\nempirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to\nthose in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in\nthe empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual\nsequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood\ndescription length may still be achievable.\n"

    "abstract": "  Theoretical analysis of interplay between the condensates $<\\bar{q},q>$ and\n$<qq>$ in vacuum is generally made by relativistic effective potentials in the\nmean field approximation in 2D, 3D and 4D models with two flavor and $N_c$\ncolor massless fermions. It is found that in ground states of these models,\ninterplay between the two condensates mainly depend on the ratio $G_S/H_S$ for\n2D and 4D case or $G_S/H_P$ for 3D case, where $G_S$, $H_S$ and $H_P$ are\nrespectively the coupling constants in a scalar $(\\bar{q},q)$, a scalar $(qq)$\nand a pseudoscalar $(qq)$ channel. In ground states of all the models, only\npure $<\\bar{q},q>$ condensates could exist if $G_S/H_S$ or $G_S/H_P$ is bigger\nthan the critical value $2/N_c$, the ratio of the color numbers of the fermions\nentering into the condensates $<qq>$ and $<\\bar{q},q>$. As $G_S/H_S$ or\n$G_S/H_P$ decreases to the region below $2/N_c$, differences of the models will\nmanifest themselves. Depending on different models, and also on $N_c$ in 3D\nmodel, one will have or have no the coexistence phase of the two condensates,\nbesides the pure $<qq>$ condensate phase. The $G_S-H_S$ (or $G_S-H_P$) phase\ndiagrams in these models are given. The results also implicate a real\nconstraint on two-flavor QCD-analogous NJL model.\n"

The particle correlation is\nstudied intuitively via the two-body densities. Bose-clustering originating\nfrom the symmetrization of wave functions is found, which leads to the\nappearance of 1-, 2-, and 3-cluster structures.

An\nabundance of examples is provided to show the sharpness of the results.\n"

    "abstract": "  This paper presents a measurement-based availability assessment study using\nfield data collected during a 4-year period from 373 SunOS/Solaris Unix\nworkstations and servers interconnected through a local area network. We focus\non the estimation of machine uptimes, downtimes and availability based on the\nidentification of failures that caused total service loss. Data corresponds to\nsyslogd event logs that contain a large amount of information about the normal\nactivity of the studied systems as well as their behavior in the presence of\nfailures. It is widely recognized that the information contained in such event\nlogs might be incomplete or imperfect. The solution investigated in this paper\nto address this problem is based on the use of auxiliary sources of data\nobtained from wtmpx files maintained by the SunOS/Solaris Unix operating\nsystem. The results obtained suggest that the combined use of wtmpx and syslogd\nlog files provides more complete information on the state of the target systems\nthat is useful to provide availability estimations that better reflect reality.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present sensitive molecular line observations of the metal-poor blue\ncompact dwarf I Zw 18 obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer.\nThese data constrain the CO J=1-0 luminosity within our 300 pc (FWHM) beam to\nbe L_CO < 1 \\times 10^5 K km s^-1 pc^2 (I_CO < 1 K km s^-1), an order of\nmagnitude lower than previous limits. Although I Zw 18 is starbursting, it has\na CO luminosity similar to or less than nearby low-mass irregulars (e.g. NGC\n1569, the SMC, and NGC 6822). There is less CO in I Zw 18 relative to its\nB-band luminosity, HI mass, or star formation rate than in spiral or dwarf\nstarburst galaxies (including the nearby dwarf starburst IC 10). Comparing the\nstar formation rate to our CO upper limit reveals that unless molecular gas\nforms stars much more efficiently in I Zw 18 than in our own galaxy, it must\nhave a very low CO-to-H_2 ratio, \\sim 10^-2 times the Galactic value. We detect\n3mm continuum emission, presumably due to thermal dust and free-free emission,\ntowards the radio peak.\n"

    "title": "A binary model for the UV-upturn of elliptical galaxies (MNRAS version)",
    "abstract": "  The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of\nelliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that\nthis UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars\nwithout large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin\nhas remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their\nenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf\npopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population\nsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the\nbinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot\nsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces\nmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of\nobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution\nwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\ngeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as\nhad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly\ndependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from\ndwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.\n"

The consequences of such a feature allows to\nestimate the gamma photometric redshift of the long gamma-ray bursts in the\nBATSE Catalog.

The Full Configuration Interaction approach is used to account for\nthe inter-electron repulsion, and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings\nare exactly diagonalized. We show that electron-electron interaction strongly\naffects spin-orbit admixture in the sample. Consequently, relaxation rates\nstrongly depend on the number of carriers confined in the dot. We identify the\nmechanisms which may lead to improved spin stability in few electron (>2)\nquantum dots as compared to the usual one and two electron devices. Finally, we\ndiscuss recent experiments on triplet-singlet transitions in GaAs dots subject\nto external magnetic fields. Our simulations are in good agreement with the\nexperimental findings, and support the interpretation of the observed spin\nrelaxation as being due to spin-orbit coupling assisted by acoustic phonon\nemission.\n"

    "abstract": "  Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,\nknown as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a\nsource-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as\nscintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One\nof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced\nvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic\nvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data\nfor the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are\npresented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this\ncompact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV\nthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the\nvariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the\nflux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and\n10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m\nUrumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the\nvariability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of\nthe variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic\nannual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is\nin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting\na simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency\ndependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the\nscattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The\nlatter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.\n"

The Cr-O\ndistance is close to that in MgCr2O4, indicating a full relaxation of the first\nneighbors, and the second shell of Al atoms relaxes partially. These\nobservations demonstrate that Vegard's law is not obeyed in the MgAl2O4-MgCr2O4\nsolid solution. Despite some angular site distortion, the local D3d symmetry of\nthe B-site of the spinel structure is retained during the substitution of Cr\nfor Al.

    "abstract": "  We present a hierarchical simulation approach for the dependability analysis\nand evaluation of a highly available commercial cache-based RAID storage\nsystem. The archi-tecture is complex and includes several layers of\noverlap-ping error detection and recovery mechanisms. Three ab-straction levels\nhave been developed to model the cache architecture, cache operations, and\nerror detection and recovery mechanism. The impact of faults and errors\noc-curring in the cache and in the disks is analyzed at each level of the\nhierarchy. A simulation submodel is associated with each abstraction level. The\nmodels have been devel-oped using DEPEND, a simulation-based environment for\nsystem-level dependability analysis, which provides facili-ties to inject\nfaults into a functional behavior model, to simulate error detection and\nrecovery mechanisms, and to evaluate quantitative measures. Several fault\nmodels are defined for each submodel to simulate cache component failures, disk\nfailures, transmission errors, and data errors in the cache memory and in the\ndisks. Some of the parame-ters characterizing fault injection in a given\nsubmodel cor-respond to probabilities evaluated from the simulation of the\nlower-level submodel. Based on the proposed method-ology, we evaluate and\nanalyze 1) the system behavior un-der a real workload and high error rate\n(focusing on error bursts), 2) the coverage of the error detection mechanisms\nimplemented in the system and the error latency distribu-tions, and 3) the\naccumulation of errors in the cache and in the disks.\n"

Explanations are of two\ntypes: modifications of Einstein gravity or new forms of energy, coined dark\nenergy.The accelerated expansion is explained here by a combination of\nDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model gravity and Chaplygin gas dark energy. Both\nmodels are characterized by a length scale L which may be the same. The\ncontinuity equation for the combined model is derived in flat geometry, and\nsolved by numerical methods.

    "abstract": "  For the 100 largest European universities we studied the statistical\nproperties of bibliometric indicators related to research performance, field\ncitation density and journal impact. We find a size-dependent cumulative\nadvantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.\nIn previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research\ngroups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property\nof the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a\nlarger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than\ntop-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance\nuniversities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with\nsize. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a\nuniversity, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the\naverage research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance\nuniversities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of\nactivities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive\npower. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities\nthe field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations\nper publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation\ndensity found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of\nthe science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with\nsignificantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance\nuniversities. We find a significant decrease of the fraction of self-citations\nwith increasing research performance, average field citation density, and\naverage journal impact.\n"

Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)\nthrough a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)\nthrough a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field\nstrength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,\nmaking different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of\nrelativistic electrons.\n  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is\nnot aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of\nambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the\ndegree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of\nthe microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models\nand observations.\n  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be\nexplained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic\nfield strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging\nsimilar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.\n"

    "abstract": "  Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are\ninvestigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\nunsynchronizable state.\n"

We obtained VRI photometry for these\n33 objects as well as for 23 known white dwarf systems without trigonometric\nparallaxes, also primarily in the southern hemisphere. For the 56 objects, we\nconverted the photometry values to fluxes and fit them to a spectral energy\ndistribution using the spectroscopy to determine which model to use (i.e. pure\nhydrogen, pure helium, or metal-rich helium), resulting in estimates of\neffective temperature and distance. Eight of the new and 12 known systems are\nestimated to be within the NStars and Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS) horizons\nof 25 pc, constituting a potential 18% increase in the nearby white dwarf\nsample. Trigonometric parallax determinations are underway via CTIOPI for these\n20 systems.\n  One of the DCs is cool so that it displays absorption in the near infrared.\nUsing the distance determined via trigonometric parallax, we are able to\nconstrain the model-dependent physical parameters and find that this object is\nmost likely a mixed H/He atmosphere white dwarf similar to other cool white\ndwarfs identified in recent years with significant absorption in the infrared\ndue to collision-induced absorptions by molecular hydrogen.\n"

    "abstract": "  Since its launch in 1999, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)\nhas made over 4600 observations of some 2500 individual targets. The data are\nreduced by the Principal Investigator team at the Johns Hopkins University and\narchived at the Multimission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST). The\ndata-reduction software package, called CalFUSE, has evolved considerably over\nthe lifetime of the mission. The entire FUSE data set has recently been\nreprocessed with CalFUSE v3.2, the latest version of this software. This paper\ndescribes CalFUSE v3.2, the instrument calibrations upon which it is based, and\nthe format of the resulting calibrated data files.\n"

Our theoretical results follow from conformal field theory, and are\ncompared with high-precision numerical simulation.

While for the former dynamical correlations and lifetime effects\nprevent a description in terms of quasi-particles, the excitations of the\nlatter allow for an effective band-structure. We construct an\norbital-dependent, but static one-particle potential that reproduces the full\nmany-body spectrum. Yet, the ground state is well beyond a static one-particle\ndescription.

    "abstract": "  For the first time we apply the methodologies of nonlinear analysis to\ninvestigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic\nWeights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function\nand Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the\nmechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the\natomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We\nalso investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,\nusing also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime\ncould superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,\nusing the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing\nmass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most\ninteresting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis\n(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of\nself-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating\nvalues indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of\nincreasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are\nidentified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.\nIn particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear\nmethods is further required.\n"

In searching for periodic modulation in this type\nof data using power spectra it can be important to use appropriate weighting of\ndata points to achieve the best sensitivity. It was recently demonstrated that\nfor Swift BAT data a simple weighting scheme can actually sometimes reduce the\nsensitivity of the power spectrum depending on source brightness. Instead, a\nmodified weighting scheme, based on the Cochran semi-weighted mean, gives\nimproved results independent of source brightness.

    "abstract": "  We have measured resonance strengths and energies for dielectronic\nrecombination (DR) of Mg-like Fe XV forming Al-like Fe XIV via N=3 -> N' = 3\ncore excitations in the electron-ion collision energy range 0-45 eV. All\nmeasurements were carried out using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the Max\nPlanck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. We have also\ncarried out new multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) calculations using the\nAUTOSTRUCTURE code. For electron-ion collision energies < 25 eV we find poor\nagreement between our experimental and theoretical resonance energies and\nstrengths. From 25 to 42 eV we find good agreement between the two for\nresonance energies. But in this energy range the theoretical resonance\nstrengths are ~ 31% larger than the experimental results. This is larger than\nour estimated total experimental uncertainty in this energy range of +/- 26%\n(at a 90% confidence level). Above 42 eV the difference in the shape between\nthe calculated and measured 3s3p(^1P_1)nl DR series limit we attribute partly\nto the nl dependence of the detection probabilities of high Rydberg states in\nthe experiment. We have used our measurements, supplemented by our\nAUTOSTRUCTURE calculations, to produce a Maxwellian-averaged 3 -> 3 DR rate\ncoefficient for Fe XV forming Fe XIV. The resulting rate coefficient is\nestimated to be accurate to better than +/- 29% (at a 90% confidence level) for\nk_BT_e > 1 eV. At temperatures of k_BT_e ~ 2.5-15 eV, where Fe XV is predicted\nto form in photoionized plasmas, significant discrepancies are found between\nour experimentally-derived rate coefficient and previously published\ntheoretical results. Our new MCBP plasma rate coefficient is 19-28% smaller\nthan our experimental results over this temperature range.\n"

In both this examples the naive choice of\nproposal chain gives rise, for some parameters, to a slowly mixing Metropolis\nchain, that is a chain whose spectral gap decreases exponentially fast (in the\ndimension $N$ of the problem). Here we show how a slight variant in the\nproposal chain can avoid this problem, keeping the mean computational cost\nsimilar to the cost of the usual Metropolis. More precisely we prove that, with\na suitable variant in the proposal, the Metropolis chain has a spectral gap\nwhich decreases polynomially in 1/N. Using some symmetry structure of the\nenergy, the method rests on allowing appropriate jumps within the energy level\nof the starting state.\n"

    "abstract": "  We detect a dip of 20-45% in the surface brightness and number counts of NVSS\nsources smoothed to a few degrees at the location of the WMAP cold spot. The\ndip has structure on scales of approximately 1-10 degrees. Together with\nindependent all-sky wavelet analyses, our results suggest that the dip in\nextragalactic brightness and number counts and the WMAP cold spot are\nphysically related, i.e., that the coincidence is neither a statistical anomaly\nnor a WMAP foreground correction problem. If the cold spot does originate from\nstructures at modest redshifts, as we suggest, then there is no remaining need\nfor non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB to explain\nthe cold spot. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen\nstatistically for NVSS source counts, can now be seen to operate on a single\nregion. To create the magnitude and angular size of the WMAP cold spot requires\na ~140 Mpc radius completely empty void at z<=1 along this line of sight. This\nis far outside the current expectations of the concordance cosmology, and adds\nto the anomalies seen in the CMB.\n"

We answer their question in the\naffirmative, but the even and odd n arguments are surprisingly disjoint. We\nthen use these results to prove stronger ones: If n >2 is even, then $\\phi$ is\njust an ordinary *-homomorphism. If n >= 3 is odd, then $\\phi$ is a difference\nof two orthogonal *-homomorphisms. Thus, there are no nontrivial *-linear\nn-homomorphisms between C*-algebras.\n"

    "abstract": "  GEMS and GOODS fields were examined to z~1.4 for galaxy interactions and\nmergers. The basic morphologies are familiar: antennae with long tidal tails,\ntidal dwarfs, and merged cores; M51-type galaxies with disk spirals and tidal\narm companions; early-type galaxies with diffuse plumes; equal-mass\ngrazing-collisions; and thick J-shaped tails beaded with star formation and\ndouble cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose\nassemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails\nand clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts.\nAntennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to\nlocal antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisions\namong early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails,\nindicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a\n5x10**9 Msun smooth red clump that could be a pure stellar condensation. Most\ntidal dwarfs are blue and probably form by gravitational instabilities in the\ngas. One tidal dwarf looks like it existed previously and was incorporated into\nthe arm tip by tidal forces. The star-forming regions in tidal arms are 10 to\n1000 times more massive than star complexes in local galaxies, although their\nseparations are about the same. If they all form by gravitational\ninstabilities, then the gaseous velocity dispersions in interacting galaxies\nhave to be larger than in local galaxies by a factor of ~5 or more; the gas\ncolumn densities have to be larger by the square of this factor.\n"

A number of theoretical approaches\nhave been used for this problem (e.g., various numbers of coupled\nStoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics). In this paper we show\nthat many of these approaches can be regarded as special cases or\napproximations to a variational formulation of the problem, in which the energy\nis minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized in\nterms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in which\nboth the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability\n(determined by the energy barrier E_b) are geometrically visible. In this\nformulation we can prove a rigorous limit on the figure of merit xi, which can\nbe no higher than 4.

Amongst the goals of our survey, one is to significantly increase\nthe number of detected extra-solar planets in a volume-limited sample to\nimprove our knowledge of their orbital elements distributions and thus obtain\nbetter constraints for planet-formation models.\n  In this paper, we present the HARPS radial-velocity data and orbital\nsolutions for 3 Solar-type stars: HD 100777, HD 190647, and HD 221287. The\nradial-velocity data of HD 100777 is best explained by the presence of a 1.1\nM_Jup planetary companion on a 384--day eccentric orbit (e=0.36). The orbital\nfit obtained for the slightly evolved star HD 190647 reveals the presence of a\nlong-period (P=1038 d) 1.9 M_Jup planetary companion on a moderately eccentric\norbit (e=0.18). HD 221287 is hosting a 3.1 M_Jup planet on a 456--day orbit.\nThe shape of this orbit is not very well constrained because of our non-optimal\ntemporal coverage and because of the presence of abnormally large residuals. We\nfind clues for these large residuals to result from spectral line profile\nvariations probably induced by stellar activity related processes.\n"

We study these varieties\nin the case of Bayesian networks, with a view towards generalizing the\nrecursive factorization theorem to situations with hidden variables. In the\ncase when the underlying graph is a tree, we show that the vanishing ideal of\nthe model is generated by the conditional independence statements implied by\ngraph. We also show that the ideal of any Bayesian network is homogeneous with\nrespect to a multigrading induced by a collection of upstream random variables.\nThis has a number of important consequences for hidden variable models.\nFinally, we relate the ideals of Bayesian networks to a number of classical\nconstructions in algebraic geometry including toric degenerations of the\nGrassmannian, matrix Schubert varieties, and secant varieties.\n"

Evidence for this has been found for\nmany families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test\nfunctions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all\none-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same\ndistribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.\nWe break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction\nterms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from\nexcess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and\ndepend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the\nexplicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing\nsums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier\ncoefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect\nto exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for\nexample, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic\ncurves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order\nbiases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank\nover Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several\nfamilies of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,\ndepending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced\ntorsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).\n"

Their L-functions\nRatios Conjecture predicts both the main and lower order terms for many\nproblems, ranging from n-level correlations and densities to mollifiers and\nmoments to vanishing at the central point. There are now many results showing\nagreement between the main terms of number theory and random matrix theory;\nhowever, there are very few families where the lower order terms are known.\nThese terms often depend on subtle arithmetic properties of the family, and\nprovide a way to break the universality of behavior. The L-functions Ratios\nConjecture provides a powerful and tractable way to predict these terms. We\ntest a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplectic\nfamily of quadratic Dirichlet characters arising from even fundamental\ndiscriminants d \\le X. For test functions supported in (-1/3, 1/3) we calculate\nall the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1/2+epsilon},) and observe perfect\nagreement with the conjecture (for test functions supported in (-1, 1) we show\nagreement up to errors of size O(X^{-epsilon},) for any epsilon).

We also show that (1) the model will support a de Sitter\nenergy in agreement with observation at the expense of a miniscule breaking of\nsupersymmetry in the compact space; (2) variations in the fine structure\nconstant are controlled by the stabilized modulus and are negligible; (3)\n``fifth''forces are carried by the stabilized modulus and are short range; (4)\nthe long time behavior of the model in four dimensions is that of a\nRobertson-Walker universe with a constant expansion rate (w = -1/3).

We find that the fraction\nof disky galaxies smoothly decreases with increasing luminosity. The large\nsample allows us to describe these trends accurately with tight linear\nrelations that are statistically robust against the uncertainty in the\nisophotal shape measurements. There is also a host of significant correlations\nbetween the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in the\noptical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, group\nhierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can be\naccurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxy\nluminosity or mass.

    "abstract": "  Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large\nN-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type\ngalaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor\nmass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold}, <\n0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\nmass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al\n(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that\ngoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type\ngalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and\ndoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that\nmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,\nand (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three\ntrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive\nearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,\nour model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies\nform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than\n95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10}, h^{-1},\n\\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass\nearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major\nmerger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central\ncusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.\n"

    "abstract": "  In Volborthite, spin-1/2 moments form a distorted Kagom\\'e lattice, of corner\nsharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ on two bonds and $J'$\non the third bond. We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that\ndespite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.\nAlthough sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very\nlarge, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy\nlifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the\ndegeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore\nintroduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same\nordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality\nHamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition\non increasing $J'/J$, from $\\sqrt 3\\times \\sqrt 3$ type order to a new\nferrimagnetic {\\em striped chirality}, order with a doubled unit cell. This is\nconfirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While\nthe saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections\nselect the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum\nlimit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system\ndiagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate\ntemperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seen\nin NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classical\nground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.\n"

Continuum\neffective-field modeling and lattice numerical simulations are reported.

    "abstract": "  The Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) on the Compton Gamma-Ray\nObservatory (CGRO) discovered gamma-ray emission from more than 67 blazars\nduring its 9 yr lifetime. We conducted an exhaustive search of the EGRET\narchives and selected all the blazars that were observed multiple times and\nwere bright enough to enable a spectral analysis using standard power-law\nmodels. The sample consists of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs), 6\nlow-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) and 2 high-frequency peaked BL Lac\nobjects (HBLs). We do not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectral\nindex with flux. Some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence for\nspectral variability. The spectrum hardens with increasing flux in a few cases.\nThere is also evidence for a flux-hardness anticorrelation at low fluxes in\nfive blazars. The well-observed blazars (3C 279, 3C 273, PKS 0528+134, PKS\n1622-297 PKS 0208-512) do not show any overall trend in the long-term spectral\ndependence on flux, but the sample shows a mixture of hard and soft states. We\nobserved a previously unreported spectral hysteresis at weekly timescales in\nall three FSRQs for which data from flares lasting for ~(3-4) weeks were\navailable. All three sources show a counterclockwise rotation, despite the\nwidely different flux profiles. We analyze the observed spectral behavior in\nthe context of various inverse Compton mechanisms believed to be responsible\nfor emission in the EGRET energy range. Our analysis uses the EGRET skymaps\nthat were regenerated to include the changes in performance during the mission.\n"

    "abstract": "  We introduce VErsatile SPectral Analysis (VESPA): a new method which aims to\nrecover robust star formation and metallicity histories from galactic spectra.\nVESPA uses the full spectral range to construct a galaxy history from synthetic\nmodels. We investigate the use of an adaptative parametrization grid to recover\nreliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is\nrobustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designed\nto return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we\ndetail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic\nand real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that the\nnumber of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on\nthe signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young\npopulation. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recover\nbetween 2 to 5 stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPA\nand our previous analysis of the SDSS sample with MOPED.\n"

For polynomial maps of C, hyperbolicity is equivalent to the condition that\nthe closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the Julia set; further,\ncritical points either iterate to an attracting cycle or infinity. For\npolynomial skew products, Jonsson (Math. Ann., 1999) established that f is\nAxiom A if and only if the closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the\nright analog of the Julia set. Here we present the analogous conclusion:\ncritical orbits either escape to infinity or accumulate on an attracting set.\nIn addition, we construct new examples of Axiom A maps demonstrating various\npostcritical behaviors.\n"

The amplitude sensitivity of the search, characterized using\nMonte Carlo simulations, is several times better than that of previous\nsearches.

    "abstract": "  We present a method to construct semi-numerical ``simulations'', which can\nefficiently generate realizations of halo distributions and ionization maps at\nhigh redshifts. Our procedure combines an excursion-set approach with\nfirst-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear\ndensity and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with our\nalgorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of\nmagnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where\nthe dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding\nand HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with\nradiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size\ndistributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger\nionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean\nhydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm\nbrightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include\ncorrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails\nof the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these\neffects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some\npreliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to\ndate: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. We\nshow that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires such\nlarge scales. The speed and dynamic range provided by our semi-numerical\napproach will be extremely useful in the modeling of early structure formation\nand reionization.\n"

However, our recent interferometric CO(3-2)\nobservations show a hint of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the rotating\ndisk, which suggests a more complex structure than previously thought. To image\nthe putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution to\nbetter understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular\ngas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear region\nof M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,\nyielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images show\nno clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the\nradio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate\nfeatures located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western\nfeature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity\ncorrespondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting\nthat this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated\nnearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the\nsame direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This\nvelocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the\nputative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed molecular\ngas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by the\njet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-\nor Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.\n"

To date, SIM remains the\nonly program with the capability of detecting and confirming rocky planets in\nthe habitable zones of nearby solar-type stars. Moreover, SIM measures masses\nand three-dimensional orbits of habitable planets around nearby stars (within\n25 pc); these are the only stars for which follow-up by other techniques is\nfeasible, such as space-based spectroscopy, ground-based interferometry, and of\ncourse TPF.\n"

    "title": "IR observations of MS 1054-03: Star Formation and its Evolution in Rich\n  Galaxy Clusters",
    "abstract": "  We study the infrared (IR) properties of galaxies in the cluster MS 1054-03\nat z=0.83 by combining MIPS 24 micron data with spectra of more than 400\ngalaxies and a very deep K-band selected catalog. 19 IR cluster members are\nselected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by their\nphotometric redshifts. We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster and\nfind strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The best\nfitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR},=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixed\nfaint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The\nrate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent\nwith that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal\nmechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the\ngeneral decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different\nenvironments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03\nalso shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, but\nthe trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. A\nnonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively and\nthe overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is\nunlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from the\nsurrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;\ninstead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their star\nformation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.\n"

    "title": "Sensor Networks with Random Links: Topology Design for Distributed\n  Consensus",
    "abstract": "  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject\nto:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since\nsensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,\nor communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive\nnumerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence\nspeed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of\na non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.\n"

    "abstract": "  The blazar PKS0537-441 has been observed by Swift between the end of 2004 and\nNovember 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the\nXRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one\nof the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared\ntelescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In\nJanuary-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical\nand X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60\nbrighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005\nobservation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,\nmonitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is\ncomparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In\nNovember 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent\nstate, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the\nJanuary-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall\nwell correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or\nhours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,\nbut the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on\nmonthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term\nvariability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a\nunique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions are\ninterpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within a\njet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation depends\non the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).\n"

The\nnonlinear interaction between the NMR and the STLR can be implemented by\nsetting the external biased flux of the CPB at certain values. The interaction\nHamiltonian between the NMR and the STLR is derived by performing Fr$\\rm\\ddot\no$hlich transformation on the total Hamiltonian of the combined system. Just by\nadiabatically keeping the CPB at the ground state, we get the standard\nparametric down-conversion Hamiltonian. The CPB plays the role of ``nonlinear\nmedia\", and the squeezed states of the NMR can be easily generated in a manner\nsimilar to the three-wave mixing in quantum optics. This is the three-wave\nmixing in a solid-state circuit.\n"

On the basis of that short\nobservation the suspicion arose that the object might be an asynchronous polar\n(Tovmassian et al. 2004). The disparity between the presumed orbital and spin\nperiod appeared to be quite unusual. Aims: We performed follow-up observations\nof the object to resolve the problem. Methods: New simultaneous spectroscopic\nand photometric observations spanning several years allowed measurements of\nradial velocities of emission and absorption lines from the secondary star and\nbrightness variations due to synchrotron emission from the primary. Results:\nNew observations show that the object is actually synchronous and its orbital\nand spin period are equal to 4.04 hours. Conclusions: We identify the source of\nconfusion of previous observations to be a high velocity component of emission\nline arousing from the stream of matter leaving L1 point.\n"

A hitherto\nunknown letter by Einstein suggests that he entertained the idea of explaining\nthe phenomenon of new stars by gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 much\nmore seriously than was previously assumed. A reexamination of the relevant\ncalculations by Einstein shows that, indeed, at least some of them most likely\ndate from early October 1915. But in support of earlier historical\ninterpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of Nova\nGeminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant context\nand motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his first\nmeeting with Erwin Freundlich during a visit in Berlin in April 1912.

Given a\nbipartite Hamiltonian H coupling two finite dimensional particles A and B, the\nentangling rate is shown to be upper bounded by c*log(d)*norm(H), where d is\nthe smallest dimension of the interacting particles, norm(H) is the operator\nnorm of H, and c is a constant close to 1. Under certain restrictions on the\ninitial state we prove analogous upper bound for the ancilla-assisted\nentangling rate with a constant c that does not depend upon dimensions of local\nancillas. The restriction is that the initial state has at most two distinct\nSchmidt coefficients (each coefficient may have arbitrarily large\nmultiplicity). Our proof is based on analysis of a mixing rate -- a functional\nmeasuring how fast entropy can be produced if one mixes a time-independent\nstate with a state evolving unitarily.\n"

    "abstract": "  MIMO technology is one of the most significant advances in the past decade to\nincrease channel capacity and has a great potential to improve network capacity\nfor mesh networks. In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each\nnode sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian\nvector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper\ncoding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector\nbroadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental\nresult will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill\nthis gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in\nthe link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh\nnetworks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging\nnon-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original\nproblem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the\ntransformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates\nLagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method\nbased on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient\nmethod. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network\nperformance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.\n"

    "abstract": "  To provide criteria in the selection of target events preferable for\nplanetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the\nprobability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the\nlensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, we\nconsider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as\nthe ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the\nphotometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from\nprevious studies that the probability increases with the increase of the\nmagnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which\nperturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost\noccurs at moderate magnifications of $A\\lesssim 20$, implying that probability\ncan be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability\nincreases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of\nevents associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even\nat magnifications as low as $A\\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target\nof very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events\nwith brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted\nevents. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the\nbrightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain\nmagnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\\lesssim\n10^{-4},$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant stars\nwith magnifications $A\\gtrsim 70$.\n"

    "abstract": "  Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of\nprotoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular\nmomentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of\noutflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications\nfor disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak\nionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able\nto effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation\nequilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk\nmidplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling\nby soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the\nconductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have\ngrown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields\ncan begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are\ngenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while\nelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the\nmagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.\n  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have\na combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated\nto 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,\nx-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150\ng/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have\naggregated to 1 micron in size.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present new X-ray timing and spectral observations of PSR J1930+1852, the\nyoung energetic pulsar at the center of the non-thermal supernova remnant\nG54.1+0.3. Using data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and Chandra\nX-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 ms\npulsar spanning 6 years. During this interval, however, the period evolution\nshows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of\n$\\dot P = 7.5112(6) \\times 10^{-13},$ s s$^{-1},$, suggesting strong timing noise\nand/or glitch activity. The X-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\\pm5%$\nmodulation) and is characterized by an asymmetric, broad profile ($\\sim 70%$\nduty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. The spectrum of the pulsed\nemission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\\Gamma =\n1.2\\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component. The\ntotal 2-10 keV flux of the pulsar is $1.7 \\times 10^{-12},$ erg cm$^{-2},$\ns$^{-1},$. These results confirm PSR J1930+1852 as a typical Crab-like pulsar.\n"

Although the main absorption component has been shown to arise in\nfront of image A, it is not established whether some absorption from other\nvelocity components is also occuring in front of image B. To tackle this\nquestion, we have observed the HCO+(2-1) absorption line during the\ncommissioning phase of the new very extended configuration of the Plateau de\nBure Interferometer, in order to trace the position of the absorption as a\nfunction of frequency. Visibility fitting of the self-calibrated data allowed\nus to achieve position accuracy between ~12 and 80 mas per velocity component.\nOur results clearly demonstrate that all the different velocity components of\nthe HCO+(2-1) absorption arise in front of the south-west image A of the\nquasar. We estimate a flux ratio fA/fB = 4.2 (-1.0;+1.8 at 106 GHz.\n"

    "title": "Cosmogenic neutrinos as a probe of the transition from Galactic to\n  extragalactic cosmic rays",
    "abstract": "  There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in\nthe spectrum of cosmic rays at $\\sim 10^{19},$ eV. A scenario interprets the\nankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\\it\nankle-transition scenario},), while the other is that the dip caused by pair\nproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\\it proton-dip\nscenario},). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\n$\\sim 10^{20},$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\sim\n10^{16},$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17},$\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\sim\n10^{18},$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.\n"

    "abstract": "  The assumption of the capture by the Solar System of the electrically charged\nPlanckian DM objects (daemons) from the galactic disk is confirmed not only by\nthe St.Petersburg (SPb) experiments detecting particles with V<30 km/s. Here\nthe daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent\nresult of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals\nobserved in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the\nSun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it\nmoves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the\niodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles\nfalling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric\norbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb\noriginates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg\ninto near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the\nSun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories\ntraverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases\nthe probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.\nCorroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields\n~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.\n"

In particular,\ntrying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by the\nHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT},x5.27x10^{17}, GeV) and the value deduced from LEP\nexperiments (2x10^{16}, GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies of\nthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relies\non the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,\ntogether with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models an\ninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizable\nlebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combined\nwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlled\nway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appear\nwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings with\nseveral Higgs doublets. We will address this potential problem, finding that\nviable scenarios can be obtained for a reasonable light Higgs spectrum.\n"

We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further\nmultiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O\nmaser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust\ncores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The\ndominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces\nthe surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material\non its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the\nnortheast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely\ntraces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1. Our observations provide direct\nevidence that S255N is forming a cluster of intermediate to high-mass stars.\n"

In an ultrafast photoinduced melting,\nthe nanoparticles are driven to a non-equilibrium transformation, characterized\nby the initial lattice deformations, nonequilibrium electron-phonon coupling,\nand upon melting, the collective bonding and debonding, transforming\nnanocrystals into shelled nanoliquids. The displasive structural excitation at\npremelting and the coherent transformation with crystal/liquid coexistence\nduring photomelting differ from the reciprocal behavior of recrystallization,\nwhere a hot lattice forms from liquid and then thermally contracts. The degree\nof structural change and the thermodynamics of melting are found to depend on\nthe size of nanoparticle.\n"

The bulk solution intercepts the four brane in a five\ndimensional black ring with the usual curvature singularity on the brane. The\nbulk geodesics restricted to the plane of rotation of the black ring are\nconstructed and their projections on the four brane match with the usual black\nring geodesics restricted to the same plane. The asymptotic nature of the bulk\ngeodesics are elucidated with reference to a bulk singularity at the AdS\nhorizon.

    "abstract": "  We describe a practical procedure for extracting the spatial structure and\nthe growth rates of slow eigenmodes of a spatially extended system, using a\nunique experimental capability both to impose and to perturb desired initial\nstates. The procedure is used to construct experimentally the spectrum of\nlinear modes near the secondary instability boundary in Rayleigh-B\\'{e},nard\nconvection. This technique suggests an approach to experimental\ncharacterization of more complex dynamical states such as periodic orbits or\nspatiotemporal chaos.\n"

In this article, we study the stability of isotropic spherical\nsymmetric galaxy models $f_{0},(E)$, for which the distribution function $f_{0},$\ndepends on the particle energy $E$ only. In the first part of the article, we\nderive the first sufficient criterion for linear instability of $f_{0},(E):$\n$f_{0},(E)$ is linearly unstable if the second-order operator \\[\nA_{0},\\equiv-\\Delta+4\\pi\\int f_{0},^{\\prime},(E)\\{I-\\mathcal{P},\\},dv \\] has a\nnegative direction, where $\\mathcal{P},$ is the projection onto the function\nspace $\\{g(E,L)\\},,$ $L$ being the angular momentum [see the explicit formula\n(\\ref{A0-radial},)]. In the second part of the article, we prove that for the\nimportant King model, the corresponding $A_{0},$ is positive definite. Such a\npositivity leads to the nonlinear stability of the King model under all\nspherically symmetric perturbations.\n"

    "abstract": "  Motivated by recent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments on\nLa-based cuprates and based on the fermiology theories, we study the spin\nsusceptibility for La-based (e.g., La$_{2-x},$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$) and Y-based (e.g.,\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$) cuprates, respectively. The spin excitation in\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is dominated by a sharp resonance peak at the frequency 40\nmeV in the superconducting state. Below and above the resonance frequency, the\nincommensurate (IC) peaks develop and the intensity of the peaks decreases\ndramatically. In the normal state, the resonant excitation does not occur and\nthe IC peaks are merged into commensurate ones. The spin excitation of\nLa$_{2-x},$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is significantly different from that of Y-based ones,\nnamely, the resonance peak does not exist due to the decreasing of the\nsuperconducting gap and the presence of the possible spin-stripe order. The\nspectra are only enhanced at the expected resonance frequency (about 18 meV)\nwhile it is still incommensurate. On the other hand, another frequency scale at\nthe frequency 55 meV is also revealed, namely the spectra are commensurate and\nlocal maximum at this frequency. We elaborate all the results based on the\nFermi surface topology and the d-wave superconductivity, and suggest that the\nspin-stripe order be also important in determining the spin excitation of\nLa-based cuprates. A coherent picture for the spin excitations is presented for\nY-based and La-based cuprates.\n"

    "abstract": "  Environmental dielectric screening effects on exciton transition energies in\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been studied quantitatively in the\nrange of dielectric constants from 1.0 to 37 by immersing SWNTs bridged over\ntrenches in various organic solvents by means of photoluminescence and the\nexcitation spectroscopies. With increasing environmental dielectric constant\n($\\epsilon_{\\rm env},$), both $E_{11},$ and $E_{22},$ exhibited a redshift by\nseveral tens meV and a tendency to saturate at a $\\epsilon_{\\rm env}, \\sim 5$\nwithout an indication of significant ($n$,$m$) dependence. The redshifts can be\nexplained by dielectric screening of the repulsive electron-electron\ninteraction. The $\\epsilon_{\\rm env},$ dependence of $E_{11},$ and $E_{22},$ can\nbe expressed by a simple empirical equation with a power law in $\\epsilon_{\\rm\nenv},$, $E_{\\rm ii}, = E_{\\rm ii},^{\\infty}, + A\\epsilon_{\\rm env},^{-\\alpha},$. We\nalso immersed a sample in sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) solution to investigate\nthe effects of wrapping SWNTs with surfactant. The resultant $E_{11},$ and\n$E_{22},$, which agree well with Weisman's data [Nano Lett. {\\bf 3},, 1235\n(2003)], are close to those of $\\epsilon_{\\rm env},$ of 2. However, in addition\nto the shift due to dielectric screening, another shift was observed so that\nthe ($2n+m$)-family patterns spread more widely, similar to that of the\nuniaxial-stress-induced shift.\n"

    "abstract": "  The on-line shortest path problem is considered under various models of\npartial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights\ncan change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in\neach round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the\nloss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing\nedges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed\nbandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the\nweights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an\nalgorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of\nthe best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by\na quantity that is proportional to 1/\\sqrt{n}, and depends only polynomially on\nthe number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear\ncomplexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension\nto the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision\nmaker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen\npath at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the\ndecision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the\nproblem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit\nsetting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns\nonly the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual\nedges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along\nwith simulation results are also presented.\n"

Level crossing\nanalysis indicates an optimum annealing temperature of around 400$^oC$ at which\nthe effective area of the $WO_3$ thin film is maximum, whereas composition of\nthe surface remains stoichiometric. The complexity of the height fluctuation of\nsurfaces was characterized by roughness, roughness exponent and lateral size of\nsurface features.

The ion\ncharge induces in the atom an electric dipole moment, which attracts it with an\nr^{-4}, dependence at large distances. In the regime considered here, the\ncharacteristic range of the atom-ion interaction is comparable or larger than\nthe characteristic size of the trapping potential, which excludes the\napplication of the contact pseudopotential. The short-range part of the\ninteraction is described in the framework of quantum-defect theory, by\nintroducing some short-range parameters, which can be related to the s-wave\nscattering length. When the separation between traps is changed we observe\ntrap-induced shape resonances between molecular bound states and vibrational\nstates of the external trapping potential. Our analysis is extended to\nquasi-one-dimensional geometries, when the scattering exhibit\nconfinement-induced resonances, similar to the ones studied before for\nshort-range interactions. For quasi-one-dimensional systems we investigate the\neffects of coupling between the center of mass and relative motion, which\noccurs for different trapping frequencies of atom and ion traps.

    "abstract": "  We review recent results obtained in the physics of the thermal Casimir force\nacting between two dielectrics, dielectric and metal, and between metal and\nsemiconductor. The detailed derivation for the low-temperature behavior of the\nCasimir free energy, pressure and entropy in the configuration of two real\ndielectric plates is presented. For dielectrics with finite static dielectric\npermittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. Hence, the\nLifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be\nconsistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric\nplates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus,\nis not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature\nasymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also\nin the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. The results are\nshown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a\nfinite static dielectric permittivity. If the dc conductivity of a dielectric\nplate is taken into account this results in the violation of the Nernst heat\ntheorem. We discuss both the experimental and theoretical results related to\nthe Casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge\ncarrier density. Discussions in the literature on the possible influence of\nspatial dispersion on the thermal Casimir force are analyzed. In conclusion,\nthe conventional Lifshitz theory taking into account only the frequency\ndispersion remains the reliable foundation for the interpretation of all\npresent experiments.\n"

    "abstract": "  A drawback of Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (K) as a function from s to the\nshortest program producing s is its noncomputability which limits its range of\napplicability. Moreover, when strings are short, the dependence of K on a\nparticular universal Turing machine U can be arbitrary. In practice one can\napproximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression\nmethods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter,\nfor example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an\nempirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable\ndefinition of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity for short sequences.\nAdditionally, a correlation in terms of distribution frequencies was found\nacross the output of two models of abstract machines, namely unidimensional\ncellular automata and deterministic Turing machine.\n"

    "abstract": "  The cosmological redshift phenomenon can be described by the dark matter\nfield fluid model, the results deduced from this model agree very well with the\nobservations. The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the\nspeed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If\nthe emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves\ntowards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend\non the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than\nc(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed\nin all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us\nis large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be\nobserved for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees\nwith current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of\nthe dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large\nredshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate\nthat it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter\nfield fluid, it is concluded that at least in time average all photons have the\nsame geometry (size and shape) in all inertial reference frames and do not have\nlength contraction effect.\n"

We review here\nthe basic results, ideas and questions presented at the session. We have\norganized this contribution into five basic questions: what is the typical\nenvironment of cool star formation, what role do hot star play in cool star\nformation, what role does environment play in planet formation, what is the\nrole of hot star winds and supernovae, and what was the formation environment\nof the Sun?

Based on a perturbative treatment of resonant\nexchanges between orbits and a rotating perturbation, Weinberg & Katz contend\nthat N-body simulations of this process will not reveal the continuum result\nunless many more than the usual numbers of particles are employed. Here I\nreport a study designed to examine their contention, finding results that show\nno dependence on the number of particles over the range usually employed up to\nthat advocated by these authors.

The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR},}, p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)},$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)},$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S},$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter. (iii) For $B\\to K\\pi\\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant\ncontributions in $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\bar K^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$ modes, in agreement\nwith the Belle measurements but larger than the BaBar result.\n"

    "abstract": "  Electrical transport of a polar heterointerface between two insulating\nperovskites, KTaO3 and SrTiO3, is studied. It is formed between a thin KTaO3\nfilm deposited on a top of TiO2- terminated (100) SrTiO3 substrate. The\nresulting (KO)1-(TiO2)0 heterointerface is expected to be hole-doped according\nto formal valences of K (1+) and Ti (4+). We observed electrical conductivity\nand mobility in the KTaO3/SrTiO3 similar to values measured earlier in\nelectron-doped LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerfaces. However, the sign of the charge\ncarriers in KTaO3/SrTiO3 obtained from the Hall measurements is negative. The\nresult is an important clue to the true origin of the doping at perovskite\noxide hetero-interfaces.\n"

Analyzing the centroids of HST/STIS spectra obtained in November\n2001, we have determined the angular separation of the binary system. Although\nwe currently have spatially resolved data for a single epoch in the orbit, the\nsuccess of our approach opens the possibility of determining the inclination,\nsini, for the system if the measurements are repeated at additional epochs.\nSince the system is potentially a double lined spectroscopic binary, the\ncombination of spectroscopic orbits for both components and the visual orbit\nwould give the distance to the system and the masses of its components, thereby\nproviding a direct measurement of a Cepheid mass.\n"

The tail emission which we consider\nis identified as a steep-decay component of the early X-ray afterglow observed\nby the X-ray Telescope onboard Swift. Using a Monte Carlo method, we derive,\nfor the first time, the distribution of the decay index of the GRB tail\nemission for various jet models. The new definitions of the zero of time and\nthe time interval of a fitting region are proposed. These definitions for\nfitting the light curve lead us an unique definition of the decay index, which\nis useful to investigate the structure of the GRB jet. We find that if the GRB\njet has a core-envelope structure, the predicted distribution of the decay\nindex of the tail has a wide scatter and has multiple peaks, which cannot be\nseen for the case of the uniform and the Gaussian jet. Therefore, the decay\nindex distribution tells us the information on the jet structure. Especially,\nif we observe events whose decay index is less than about 2, both the uniform\nand the Gaussian jet models will be disfavored according to our simulation\nstudy.\n"

The specific heats and nearest-neighbor spin-spin\ncorrelations are calculated thoughout the entire temperature and anisotropy\nranges in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions, obtaining a global\ndescription and quantitative results. We obtain, for all anisotropies, the\nantiferromagnetic spin-liquid spin-wave velocity and the Isinglike\nferromagnetic excitation spectrum gap, exhibiting the spin-wave to spinon\ncrossover. A number of characteristics of purely quantum nature are found: The\nin-plane interaction s_i^x s_j^x + s_i^y s_j^y induces an antiferromagnetic\ncorrelation in the out-of-plane s_i^z component, at higher temperatures in the\nantiferromagnetic XXZ chain, dominantly at low temperatures in the\nferromagnetic XXZ chain, and, in-between, at all temperatures in the XY chain.\nWe find that the converse effect also occurs in the antiferromagnetic XXZ\nchain: an antiferromagnetic s_i^z s_j^z interaction induces a correlation in\nthe s_i^xy component. As another purely quantum effect, (i) in the\nantiferromagnet, the value of the specific heat peak is insensitive to\nanisotropy and the temperature of the specific heat peak decreases from the\nisotropic (Heisenberg) with introduction of either type (Ising or XY)\nanisotropy; (ii) in complete contrast, in the ferromagnet, the value and\ntemperature of the specific heat peak increase with either type of anisotropy.\n"

We prove that they are well-posed in a standard norm despite the\ndegeneracy. By wellposedness we mean a stable dependence of the solution on the\nright-hand side. A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into\nseparate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is\nused. We revisit the traditional Ladygenskaya--Babu\\v{s},ka--Brezzi (LBB) or\ninf--sup condition as well as the standard coercivity condition, and analyze\nhow they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We\nsuggest and discuss generalized conditions that cover the degenerate case. The\nLBB or inf--sup condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness of the\nproblem with respect to the Lagrange multiplier under some assumptions. The\ngeneralized coercivity condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness\nof the problem with respect to the primary unknown under some other\nassumptions. We connect the generalized coercivity condition to the\npositiveness of the minimum gap of relevant subspaces, and propose several\nequivalent expressions for the minimum gap. Our results provide a foundation\nfor research on uniform wellposedness of mixed formulations of symmetric\nproblems with large jumps in coefficients in a standard norm, independent of\nthe jumps. Such problems appear, e.g., in numerical simulations of composite\nmaterials made of components with contrasting properties.\n"

    "abstract": "  We argue that all transient searches for planets in globular clusters have a\nvery low detection probability. Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs.\n"

    "abstract": "  The hydrodynamics, describing dynamical effects in superfluid neutron stars,\nessentially differs from the standard one-fluid hydrodynamics. In particular,\nwe have four bulk viscosity coefficients in the theory instead of one. In this\npaper we calculate these coefficients, for the first time, assuming they are\ndue to non-equilibrium beta-processes (such as modified or direct Urca\nprocess). The results of our analysis are used to estimate characteristic\ndamping times of sound waves in superfluid neutron stars. It is demonstrated\nthat all four bulk viscosity coefficients lead to comparable dissipation of\nsound waves and should be considered on the same footing.\n"

    "abstract": "  Recently it has been shown that string instanton effects may give rise to\nneutrino Majorana masses in certain classes of semi-realistic string\ncompactifications. In this paper we make a systematic search for supersymmetric\nMSSM-like Type II Gepner orientifold constructions admitting boundary states\nassociated with instantons giving rise to neutrino Majorana masses and other L-\nand/or B-violating operators. We analyze the zero mode structure of D-brane\ninstantons on general type II orientifold compactifications, and show that only\ninstantons with O(1) symmetry can have just the two zero modes required to\ncontribute to the 4d superpotential. We however discuss how the addition of\nfluxes and/or possible non-perturbative extensions of the orientifold\ncompactifications would allow also instantons with $Sp(2)$ and U(1) symmetries\nto generate such superpotentials. In the context of Gepner orientifolds with\nMSSM-like spectra, we find no models with O(1) instantons with just the\nrequired zero modes to generate a neutrino mass superpotential. On the other\nhand we find a number of models in one particular orientifold of the Gepner\nmodel $(2,4,22,22)$ with $Sp(2)$ instantons with a few extra uncharged\nnon-chiral zero modes which could be easily lifted by the mentioned effects. A\nfew more orientifold examples are also found under less stringent constraints\non the zero modes. This class of $Sp(2)$ instantons have the interesting\nproperty that R-parity conservation is automatic and the flavour structure of\nthe neutrino Majorana mass matrices has a simple factorized form.\n"

The coexistence of these\ntwo order parameters in a single phase is possible because the magnetic order\nis linked to the formation of a spin density wave, and its order parameter is\nnot associated to a spectral gap but to an energy shift of the paramagnetic\nbands. This peculiarity entails several distinct features in the phase diagram\nand the spectral properties of the model, which may have been observed in\nCeRhIn$_5$. Apart from the coexistence, we find an abrupt suppression of the\nspin density wave when the superconducting and magnetic ordering temperatures\nare equal.

    "abstract": "  The vacuum dependence on boundary conditions in quantum field theories is\nanalysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective the\nrenormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the\ncouplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the\nspace of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large\nvariety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points\nincludes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field\ntheories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed\npoints. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are\nconformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions\nare infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary\nconditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes\nwe analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the\nrenormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy\nevolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does\nnot affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in\none-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.\n"

Other harmonics will affect the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of systems currently believed to be observable by LISA.\nMore significantly, inclusion of other harmonics in our matched filters would\nmean that more massive systems that were previously thought to be {\\it not},\nvisible in LISA should be detectable with reasonable SNRs. Our estimates show\nthat we should be able to significantly increase the mass reach of LISA and\nobserve the more commonly occurring supermassive black holes of masses $\\sim\n10^8M_\\odot.$ More specifically, with the inclusion of all known harmonics LISA\nwill be able to observe even supermassive black hole coalescences with total\nmass $\\sim 10^8 M_\\odot (10^9M_\\odot)$ (and mass-ratio 0.1) for a low frequency\ncut-off of $10^{-4},{\\rm Hz},$ $(10^{-5},{\\rm Hz},)$ with an SNR up to $\\sim 60$\n$(\\sim 30)$ at a distance of 3 Gpc. This is important from the astrophysical\nviewpoint since observational evidence for the existence of black holes in this\nmass range is quite strong and binaries containing such supermassive black\nholes will be inaccessible to LISA if one uses as detection templates only the\ndominant harmonic.\n"

    "abstract": "  Addition theorems are principal tools that express a function $f (\\bm{r}, \\pm\n\\bm{r},')$ in terms of products of other functions that only depend on either\n$\\bm{r},$ or $\\bm{r},'$. The best known example of such an addition theorem is\nthe Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic\ntwo-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. {\\bf 309},, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived\none-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit $\\beta \\to\n0$ in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential\n$\\exp \\bigl(-\\beta | \\bm{r},-\\bm{r},'| \\bigr) /| \\bm{r},-\\bm{r},'|$. At first\nsight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point\nof view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases\nfundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of\nfunctions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but\nGuseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal\nSlater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a\ndangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the\none-center limit $\\bm{r},' = \\bm{0},$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition\ntheorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist.\nMoreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces\nimplicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the\nCoulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition\ntheorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the\nsense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.\n"

The implications are obtained by considering direct sums\nof channels (or states) for which we show how to obtain several information\ntheoretic quantities from their values on the summands. This provides a simple\nand general tool for lifting additivity results.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present an Ha spectral observation of a Balmer-dominated shock on the\neastern side of Tycho's supernova remnant using the Subaru Telescope. Utilizing\nthe High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS), we measure the spatial variation of the\nline profile between preshock and postshock gas. Our observation clearly shows\na broadening and centroid shift of the narrow-component postshock Ha line\nrelative to the Ha emission from the preshock gas. The observation supports the\nexistence of a thin precursor where gas is heated and accelerated ahead of the\nshock. Furthermore, the spatial profile of the emission ahead of the Balmer\nfilament shows a gradual gradient in the Ha intensity and line width ahead of\nthe shock. We propose that this region (~10^16 cm) is likely to be the\nspatially resolved precursor. The line width increases from ~30 up to ~45 km/s,\nand its central velocity shows a redshift of ~5 km/s across the shock front.\nThe characteristics of the precursor are consistent with a cosmic-ray\nprecursor, although the possibility of a fast neutral precursor is not ruled\nout.\n"

The\npaper contains a universal construction for orbits which satisfy the inclusion\n$Gv\\subset T^\\bbC v$ and a characterization of pairs $(G,V)$ such that it is\ntrue for a generic $v\\in V$. The hull of a finite union of $T$-orbits in\n$T^\\bbC v$ can be distinguished in $\\clos T^\\bbC v$ by a finite collection of\ninequalities of the type $\\abs{z_1},^{s_1},...\\abs{z_n},^{s_n},\\leq c$.

The\nresults are consistent with a phase-coherence transition scenario where the\ncritical temperature vanishes. The linear resistivity is nonzero at any finite\ntemperatures but nonlinear behavior sets in at a temperature-dependent\ncrossover current determined by the thermal critical exponent. From a dynamic\nscaling analysis we determine this critical exponent and the thermally\nactivated behavior of the linear resistivity. The results are in agreement with\nearlier calculations using the resistively shunted-junction model for the\ndynamics of the array. The linear resistivity behavior is consistent with some\nexperimental results on arrays of superconducting grains but not on wire\nnetworks, which we argue have been obtained in a current regime above the\ncrossover current.\n"

High spatial resolution studies of IM young\nstellar objects (YSO) can provide important clues to understand the clustering\nin massive star forming regions.\n  Aims: Our aim is to search for clustering in IM Class 0 protostars. The high\nspatial resolution and sensitivity provided by the new A configuration of the\nPlateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) allow us to study the clustering in these\nnearby objects.\n  Methods: We have imaged three IM Class 0 protostars (Serpens-FIRS 1, IC 1396\nN, CB 3) in the continuum at 3.3 and 1.3mm using the PdBI. The sources have\nbeen selected with different luminosity to investigate the dependence of the\nclustering process on the luminosity of the source.\n  Results: Only one millimeter (mm) source is detected towards the low\nluminosity source Serpens--FIRS 1. Towards CB 3 and IC1396 N, we detect two\ncompact sources separated by $\\sim$0.05 pc. The 1.3mm image of IC 1396 N, which\nprovides the highest spatial resolution, reveal that one of these cores is\nsplitted in, at least, three individual sources.\n"

The former description implies that changing trading\nfrequency should alter the characteristic time of the phenomenon. This is not\ntrue for the empirical data: The Epps curves do not scale with market activity.\nThe latter result indicates that the time scale of the phenomenon is connected\nto the reaction time of market participants (this we denote as human time\nscale), independent of market activity. In this paper we give a new description\nof the Epps effect through the decomposition of cross-correlations. After\ntesting our method on a model of generated random walk price changes we justify\nour analytical results by fitting the Epps curves of real world data.\n"

We determine the coefficients, which we call star\nfactorization numbers, that occur in the resolution of transitive powers with\nrespect to the class basis of the centre of S_n, and show that they have a\npolynomiality property. These centrality and polynomiality properties have\nseemingly unrelated consequences. First, they answer a question raised by Pak\nabout reduced decompositions; second, they explain and extend the beautiful\nsymmetry result discovered by Irving and Rattan; and thirdly, we relate the\npolynomiality to an existing polynomiality result for a class of double Hurwitz\nnumbers associated with branched covers of the sphere, which therefore suggests\nthat there may be an ELSV-type formula associated with the star factorization\nnumbers.\n"

    "abstract": "  The contribution of a spin-rich $qqq$ force (in conjunction with pairwise\n$qq$ forces) to the analytical structure of the $qqq$ wave function is worked\nout in the high momentum regime of QCD where the confining interaction may be\nignored, so that the dominant effect is $Coulombic$. A distinctive feature of\nthis study is that the spin-rich $qqq$ force is generated by a $ggg$ vertex (a\ngenuine part of the QCD Lagrangian) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on\nas many quark lines, giving rise to a (Mercedes-Benz type) $Y$-shaped diagram.\nThe dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D support for the kernel)\nformulated covariantly on the light front, a la Markov-Yukawa Transversality\nPrinciple (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way interconnection between the 3D and 4D\nBethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2 as well as 3 fermion quarks. With these\ningredients, the differential equation for the 3D wave function $\\phi$ receives\nwell-defined contributions from the $qq$ and $qqq$ forces. In particular a\n$negative$ eigenvalue of the spin operator $i \\sigma_1.\\sigma_2\\times \\sigma_3$\nwhich is an integral part of the $qqq$ force, causes a characteristic\nsingularity in the differential equation, signalling the dynamical effect of a\nspin-rich $qqq$ force not yet considered in the literature. The potentially\ncrucial role of this interesting effect vis-a-vis the so-called `spin anomaly'\nof the proton, is a subject of considerable physical interest.\n"

    "abstract": "  Data from {\\it Chandra}, observations of thirty nearby galaxies were analyzed\nand 365 X-ray point sources were chosen whose spectra were not contaminated by\nexcessive diffuse emission and not affected by photon pile up. The spectra of\nthese sources were fitted using two spectral models (an absorbed power-law and\na disk blackbody) to ascertain the dependence of estimated parameters on the\nspectral model used. It was found that the cumulative luminosity function\ndepends on the choice of the spectral model, especially for luminosities $>\n10^{40},$ ergs/s. In accordance with previous results, a large number ($\\sim\n80$) of the sources have luminosities $> 10^{39},$ ergs/s (Ultra-Luminous X-ray\nsources) with indistinguishable average spectral parameters (inner disk\ntemperature $\\sim 1$ keV and/or photon index $\\Gamma \\sim 2$) with those of the\nlower luminosities ones. After considering foreground stars and known\nbackground AGN,we identify four sources whose minimum luminosity exceed\n$10^{40},$ ergs/s, and call them Extremely Luminous X-ray sources (ELX). The\nspectra of these sources are in general better represented by the disk black\nbody model than the power-law one. These ELX can be grouped into two distinct\nspectral classes. Two of them have an inner disk temperature of $< 0.5$ keV and\nhence are called ``supersoft'' ELX, while the other two have temperatures\n$\\gtrsim 1.3$ keV and are called ``hard'' ELX. The estimated inner disk\ntemperatures of the supersoft ELX are compatible with the hypothesis that they\nharbor intermediate size black holes, which are accreting at $\\sim 0.5$ times\ntheir Eddington Luminosity. The radiative mechanism for hard ELX, seems to be\nInverse Comptonization, which in contrast to standard black holes systems, is\nprobably saturated.\n"

    "abstract": "  [Abridged] We have studied the optical spectra of 28 O- and early B-type\nstars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 22 of which are associated with the young\nstar-forming region N11. Stellar parameters are determined using an automated\nfitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND with the\ngenetic-algorithm optimisation routine PIKAIA. Results for stars in the LH9 and\nLH10 associations of N11 are consistent with a sequential star formation\nscenario, in which activity in LH9 triggered the formation of LH10. Our sample\ncontains four stars of spectral type O2, of which the hottest is found to be\n~49-54 kK (cf. ~45-46 kK for O3 stars). The masses of helium-enriched dwarfs\nand giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotating\nevolutionary tracks. We interpret this as evidence for efficient\nrotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and to\nan increase of the stellar luminosity. This result is consistent with findings\nfor SMC stars by Mokiem et al. For bright giants and supergiants no such\nmass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly\n(or non-)rotating objects. Stellar mass-loss properties were found to be\nintermediate to those found in massive stars in the Galaxy and the SMC, and\ncomparisons with theoretical predictions at LMC metallicity yielded good\nagreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 < log L/L(sun) <\n6.1.\n"

These results,\ncombined with the recent determination of the strange vector form factors at\n$Q^2 = 0.1$ GeV$^2$ (SAMPLE, HAPPEx, PVA4, G0) have been interpreted in terms\nof $uuds\\bar{s},$ configurations very different from the kaon-loop\nconfigurations usually associated with strangeness in the nucleon. New\nexperiments are being proposed to improve the state of our knowledge of the\n$\\nu p$ elastic cross section -- these new experiments will push the range of\n$Q^2$ to much lower values, and greatly increase the precision of the $\\nu p$\nelastic data. One outcome of this can be a measurement of the strangeness\ncontribution to the nucleon spin, $\\Delta s$. Nuclear targets (e.g. C or Ar)\nare to be used in these neutrino experiments, and so a deep understanding of\nthe nuclear physics, particularly in regard to final state effects, is needed\nbefore the potential of these precision experiments can be fully realized.\n"

The nebula of one source has a centrally peaked,\nrounded appearance. In the other two objects, it consists of two spatial\ncomponents. The three nebulae are aligned with the radio axis within <30 deg.\nThe total Ly-alpha luminosities are in the range (0.3-3.4) x 1e44 erg s-1. The\nLy-alpha spectral profile shows strong variation through the nebulae, with FWHM\nvalues in the range ~400-1500 km s-1 and velocity shifts V~120-600 km s-1.\n  We present an infall model which can explain successfully most Ly-alpha\nmorphological and spectroscopic properties of the nebula associated with MRC\n1558-003. This adds further support to our previous conclusion that the\n_quiescent_ giant nebulae associated with this and other high redshift powerful\nradio galaxies are in infall. A problem for this model is the difficulty to\nreproduce the large Ly-alpha FWHM values.\n  We have discovered a giant (~85 kpc) Ly-alpha nebula associated with the\nradio galaxy MRC 0140-257 at z=2.64. It shows strikingly relaxed kinematics\n(FWHM< 300 km s-1 and V<120 km s-1), unique among high z (>2) radio galaxies.\n"

But how good really is our ability to control? How\nsuccessful is our track record in these areas? There is little understanding of\nwhen and under what circumstances we may over-estimate or even lose our ability\nto control and optimize outcomes, especially when they are the result of\naggregations of individual optimization processes. Here, we demonstrate\nanalytically using the theory of Markov Chains and by numerical simulations in\ntwo classes of games, the Minority game and the Parrondo Games, that agents who\noptimize their strategy based on past information actually perform worse than\nnon-optimizing agents. In other words, low-entropy (more informative)\nstrategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies. This provides a\nprecise definition of the \"illusion of control\" in set-ups a priori defined to\nemphasize the importance of optimization.\n"

    "abstract": "  The two-dimensional kinetic Ising model, when exposed to an oscillating\napplied magnetic field, has been shown to exhibit a nonequilibrium,\nsecond-order dynamic phase transition (DPT), whose order parameter Q is the\nperiod-averaged magnetization. It has been established that this DPT falls in\nthe same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the\ntwo-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the first\ntime the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero,\nperiod-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by a\nsquare-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent,\n\\delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent for\nthe critical isotherm, \\delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This implies\nthat H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-size\nscaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period\nprovides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that,\nfor a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, a\nfluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperature\nT_{eff},(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature and\nfield amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b. This FDR justifies the use\nof the scaled variance of Q as a proxy for the nonequilibrium susceptibility,\n\\partial<Q> / \\partial H_b, in the critical region.\n"

This area is marked\nby the presence of highly disturbed local HI and a preponderance of\nintermediate- and high-velocity gas. The HI distribution toward the brightest\npeaks in the WMAP Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map for this area is\nexamined and by comparing with a second area on the sky it is demonstrated that\nthe associations do not appear to be the result of chance coincidence. Close\nexamination of several of the associations reveals important new properties of\ndiffuse interstellar neutral hydrogen structure. In the case of high-velocity\ncloud MI, the HI and WMAP ILC morphologies are similar and an excess of soft\nX-ray emission and H-alpha emission have been reported for this feature. It is\nsuggested that the small angular-scale, high frequency continuum emission\nobserved by WMAP may be produced at the surfaces of HI features interacting one\nanother, or at the interface between moving HI structures and regions of\nenhanced plasma density in the surrounding interstellar medium. It is possible\nthat dust grains play a role in producing the emission. However, the primary\npurpose of this report is to draw attention to these apparent associations\nwithout offering an unambiguous explanation as to the relevant emission\nmechanism(s).\n"

    "abstract": "  The effect of the electron density stratification on the intensity profiles\nof the H I Ly-$\\alpha$ line and the O VI and Mg X doublets formed in solar\ncoronal holes is investigated. We employ an analytical 2-D model of the large\nscale coronal magnetic field that provides a good representation of the corona\nat the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation to\ndetermine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar\ncorona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The\nmain assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the\ncoronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun\nfrom the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are\nsensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification.\nHowever, Ly-$\\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The\ncalculated total intensities of Ly-$\\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a\nlesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed\nones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed\nprofiles of Ly-$\\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered\nelectron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few\nstratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data\nresult in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close\nto the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions\nare employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered\nobservables with good accuracy. Thus the need for a strong anisotropy of the\nvelocity distribution (i.e. a temperature anisotropy) is not so clear cut as\nprevious investigations of UVCS data suggested. ...\n"

    "title": "SW Sextantis stars: the dominant population of CVs with orbital periods\n  between 3-4 hours",
    "abstract": "  [Abridged] We present time-series optical photometry of five new CVs\nidentified by the Hamburg Quasar Survey. The eclipses observed in HS 0129+2933,\nHS 0220+0603, and HS 0455+8315 provided very accurate orbital periods of\n3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. HS\n0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)\nh. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS\n0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbital\nperiod of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed\nphotometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic\nbehaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new\nadditions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent\nof the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the\nrequirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the\nmodels based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand,\nthe predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming\nmore pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period\ninterval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by\nour results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the\nHamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital\nperiods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close\nto the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the\nstandard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the\nhighest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range of\ncommon properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit.\n"

    "abstract": "  Young energetic pulsars will likely be the largest class of Galactic sources\nobserved by GLAST, with many hundreds detected. Many will be unknown as radio\npulsars, making pulsation detection dependent on radio and/or x-ray\nobservations or on blind periodicity searches of the gamma-rays. Estimates for\nthe number of pulsars GLAST will detect in blind searches have ranged from tens\nto many hundreds. I argue that the number will be near the low end of this\nrange, partly due to observations being made in a scanning as opposed to a\npointing mode. This paper briefly reviews how blind pulsar searches will be\nconducted using GLAST, what limits these searches, and how the computations and\nstatistics scale with various parameters.\n"

    "title": "Did time begin? Will time end?",
    "abstract": "  Did time begin at a Big Bang? Will the present expansion of the universe last\nfor a finite or infinite time? These questions sound philosophical but are\nbecoming, now in the twenty-first century, central to the scientific study of\ncosmology. The answers, which should become clarified in the next decade or\ntwo, could have profound implications for how we see our own role in the\nuniverse. Since the original publication of Stephen Hawking's {\\it A Brief\nHistory of Time}, in 1988, the answers to these questions have progressed as a\nresult of research by the community of active theoretical physicists including\nmyself. To present the underlying ideas requires discussion of a wide range of\ntopics in cosmology, especially the make up of the energy content of the\nuniverse. A brief summary of my conclusions, that of three different\npossibilities concerning the history and future of time, the least likely is\nthe conventional wisdom (time began and will never end) and most likely is a\ncyclic model (time never begins or ends), is in the short final Chapter which\ncould be read first. To understand the reasoning leading to my conclusions\ncould encourage reading of my entire book. My hope in writing this, my first\npopular book, is that it will engender reflection about time. Many a\nnon-scientist may already hold a philosophical opinion about whether time\nbegins and ends. This book's aim is to present some recently discovered\nscientific facts which can focus the reader's consideration of the two short\nquestions in my title.\n"

SFC permits measurement of\nangular dependence of light-scattering intensity (indicatrix) of single\nparticles. A mature RBC is modeled as a biconcave disk in DDA simulations of\nlight scattering. We have studied the effect of RBC orientation related to the\ndirection of the incident light upon the indicatrix. Numerical calculations of\nindicatrices for several aspect ratios and volumes of RBC have been carried\nout. Comparison of the simulated indicatrices and indicatrices measured by SFC\nshowed good agreement, validating the biconcave disk model for a mature RBC. We\nsimulated the light-scattering output signals from the SFC with the DDA for\nRBCs modeled as a disk-sphere and as an oblate spheroid. The biconcave disk,\nthe disk-sphere, and the oblate spheroid models have been compared for two\norientations, i.e. face-on and rim-on incidence. Only the oblate spheroid model\nfor rim-on incidence gives results similar to the rigorous biconcave disk\nmodel.\n"

    "abstract": "  A general class of loop quantizations for anisotropic models is introduced\nand discussed, which enhances loop quantum cosmology by relevant features seen\nin inhomogeneous situations. The main new effect is an underlying lattice which\nis being refined during dynamical changes of the volume. In general, this leads\nto a new feature of dynamical difference equations which may not have constant\nstep-size, posing new mathematical problems. It is discussed how such models\ncan be evaluated and what lattice refinements imply for semiclassical behavior.\nTwo detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong\nconstraints on suitable refinement models, even in the absence of a fundamental\nHamiltonian which defines changes of the underlying lattice. Thus, a large\nclass of consistency tests of loop quantum gravity becomes available. In this\ncontext, it will also be seen that quantum corrections due to inverse powers of\nmetric components in a constraint are much larger than they appeared recently\nin more special treatments of isotropic, free scalar models where they were\nartificially suppressed.\n"

    "abstract": "  It is known that when hard spheres are added to a pure system of hard rods\nthe stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this\neffect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper\nwe first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this\nparticular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting\nthe usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations\nfrozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres\nof different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results\nindicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease\nsignificantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when\ncompared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation\napproximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\\tau$ parameter,\nwhich has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We\npresent closed expressions for $\\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected\nwith the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry\nby comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes\n(spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results\nbased on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure\ndensity--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of\ndifferent sizes. In this case, we show that the $\\tau$ parameter exhibits a\nlinear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod\naspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of\nlarge values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast\nto Onsager approximation, which predicts $\\tau\\sim d^3$.\n"

The\nB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements of\nthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit on\nthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severe\nfor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering the\nnon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrary\nthese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the\nHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection of\nnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the available\nATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs search\nchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameter\nspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collider\nsensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that it\nmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for small\nor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.\n"

These so-called ``plasma puddles'' are\nmeta-stable lumps of hot plasma lying in locally un-Higgsed regions of space.\nThey decay via O(1/N) thermal radiation and, perhaps surprisingly, absorb all\nincident matter. We show that an incident particle of energy E striking the\nplasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose\nmultiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of\nE. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by\nthe plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross\nproperties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of\nfundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the\nplasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black\n(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which\nimplies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS/CFT\nduality and the many similarities between plasma puddles and black holes, we\nconjecture that black objects are a robust feature of quantum gravity.\n"

The unifying thread of this somewhat chaotic essay is\nthe concept of Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov Complexity, for\nshort). I argue that it is natural to interpret cognition as the art of finding\nalgorithms that apprach the Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin (algorithmic)\nComplexity limit with appropriate tradeoffs. In addition, I claim that what we\ncall the universe is an interpreted abstraction--a mental construct--based on\nthe observed coherence between multiple sensory input streams and our own\ninteractions. Hence, the notion of Universe is itself a model.\n"

    "abstract": "  We analyze several aspects of the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in\nreaction-diffusion systems, exploiting the nonequilibrium potential's\nframework. The generalization of this formalism (sketched in the appendix) to\nextended systems is first carried out in the context of a simplified scalar\nmodel, for which stationary patterns can be found analytically. We first show\nhow system-size stochastic resonance arises naturally in this framework, and\nthen how the phenomenon of array-enhanced stochastic resonance can be further\nenhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less\ntrivial generalization is exemplified by a stylized version of the\nFitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigm of the activator-inhibitor class. After\ndiscussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from\nit -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective\nscalar model that includes a nonlocal contribution. Studying the role played by\nthe range of the nonlocal kernel and its effect on stochastic resonance, we\nfind an optimal range that maximizes the system's response.\n"

    "abstract": "  When a source emits a gravity-wave (GW) pulse over a short period of time,\nthe leading edge of the GW signal is redshifted more than the inner boundary of\nthe pulse. The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the\nself-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for\nGW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the\nevolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the\nsource. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration\nof the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be\nrelevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a\nradius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge\nbetween binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated\nGW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001. Accounting for the wave\ndistortion would significantly decrease the waveform extraction errors in\nnumerical simulations.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present ground-based B and R-band color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs),\nreaching the oldest main-sequence turnoffs with good photometric accuracy for\ntwelve fields in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our fields, located between\n~1 and ~4 degrees from the center of the galaxy, are situated in different\nparts of the SMC such as the \"Wing'' area, and towards the West and South. In\nthis paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fields\nthrough comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). We\nfind that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of\nboth intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show\nstrong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in\nthe Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the\neastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star\nformation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the\nwestern side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF\nanalysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these\nparts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located in\nthe southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southern\nfields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the\nCMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferred\nfrom the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here are\ndominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lack\nof a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicate\nthat a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observed\nfields.\n"

The scale invariance of the spectrum is\nrealized by a tachyonic instability in the isocurvature field. This instability\ndrives the scaling solution to the late time attractor that is the old\nekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single field. We show that the transition\nfrom the scaling solution to the single field dominated ekpyrotic collapse\nautomatically converts the initial isocurvature perturbations about the scaling\nsolution to comoving curvature perturbations about the late-time attractor. The\nfinal amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbation is determined by the\nHubble scale at the transition.\n"

Once\nthe hoop conjecture is assumed a number of results can be obtained directly:\nthe existence of a fundamental uncertainty in spatial distance of order the\nPlanck length, bounds on information (entropy) in a finite region, and a bound\non the rate of information processing in a finite region. In the final section\nI discuss some cosmological issues related to the total amount of information\nin the universe, and note that almost all detailed aspects of the late universe\nare determined by the randomness of quantum outcomes.

    "abstract": "  The local, uncorrelated multiplicative noises driving a second-order, purely\nnoise-induced, ordering phase transition (NIPT) were assumed to be Gaussian and\nwhite in the model of [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{73},, 3395 (1994)]. The\npotential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for a\nstudy of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task is\nfacilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of\nOrnstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a\nvariance reduced by the self-correlation time (\\tau), and whose effect on the\nNIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when\nthe stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\\emph{Gaussian}, which, being a\n\\emph{fat-tail}, distribution for (q>1) and a \\emph{compact-support}, one for\n(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from\nGaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other\nphenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field\napproximation and with an emphasis on the \\emph{order parameter}, and the\n``\\emph{susceptibility},''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises'\nstatistics and spectrum. Even for relatively small (\\tau), it is shown that\nwhereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of\nself-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it. Also, an interesting\neffect on the susceptibility is seen in the last case.\n"

    "abstract": "  Despite progress in the theoretical knowledge of open cluster remnants and\nthe growing search for observational identifications in recent years, open\nquestions still remain. The methods used to analyze open cluster remnants and\ncriteria to define them as physical systems are not homogeneous. In this work\nwe present a systematic method for studying these objects that provides a view\nof their properties and allows their characterization. Eighteen remnant\ncandidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. These\ndata provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria for\ncharacterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties into\naccount. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structural\nproperties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) to\ntest for any similarity between objects and fields with a statistical\ncomparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii)\nto obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an index\nof isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objective\ncomparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields. The objective\nanalysis based on the present methods indicates 13 open-cluster remnants in the\nsample. Evidence of the presence of binary stars is found, as expected for\ndynamically evolved systems. Finally, we infer possible evolutionary stages\namong remnants from the structure, proper motion, and CMD distributions. The\nlow stellar statistics for individual objects is overcome by means of the\nconstruction of composite proper motion and CMD diagrams. The distributions of\nremnants in the composite diagrams resemble the single-star and unresolved\nbinary star distributions of open clusters.\n"

    "abstract": "  The present paper introduces a linear reformulation of the Kuramoto model\ndescribing a self-synchronizing phase transition in a system of globally\ncoupled oscillators that in general have different characteristic frequencies.\nThe reformulated model provides an alternative coherent framework through which\none can analytically tackle synchronization problems that are not amenable to\nthe original Kuramoto analysis. It allows one to solve explicitly for the\nsynchronization order parameter and the critical point of 1) the full\nphase-locking transition for a system with a finite number of oscillators\n(unlike the original Kuramoto model, which is solvable implicitly only in the\nmean-field limit) and 2) a new class of continuum systems. It also makes it\npossible to probe the system's dynamics as it moves towards a steady state.\nWhile discussion in this paper is restricted to systems with global coupling,\nthe new formalism introduced by the linear reformulation also lends itself to\nsolving systems that exhibit local or asymmetric coupling.\n"

    "abstract": "  Any homogeneous polynomial $P(x, y, z)$ of degree $d$, being restricted to a\nunit sphere $S^2$, admits essentially a unique representation of the form\n$\\lambda + \\sum_{k = 1},^d [\\prod_{j = 1},^k L_{kj},]$, where $L_{kj},$'s are\nlinear forms in $x, y$ and $z$ and $\\lambda$ is a real number. The coefficients\nof these linear forms, viewed as 3D vectors, are called \\emph{multipole},\nvectors of $P$. In this paper we consider similar multipole representations of\npolynomial and analytic functions on other quadratic surfaces $Q(x, y, z) = c$,\nreal and complex. Over the complex numbers, the above representation is not\nunique, although the ambiguity is essentially finite. We investigate the\ncombinatorics that depicts this ambiguity. We link these results with some\nclassical theorems of harmonic analysis, theorems that describe decompositions\nof functions into sums of spherical harmonics. We extend these classical\ntheorems (which rely on our understanding of the Laplace operator\n$\\Delta_{S^2},$) to more general differential operators $\\Delta_Q$ that are\nconstructed with the help of the quadratic form $Q(x, y, z)$. Then we introduce\nmodular spaces of multipoles. We study their intricate geometry and topology\nusing methods of algebraic geometry and singularity theory. The multipole\nspaces are ramified over vector or projective spaces, and the compliments to\nthe ramification sets give rise to a rich family of $K(\\pi, 1)$-spaces, where\n$\\pi$ runs over a variety of modified braid groups.\n"

    "abstract": "  A new kinematic and dynamic study of the halo of the giant elliptical galaxy,\nNGC 5128, is presented. From a spectroscopically confirmed sample of 340\nglobular clusters and 780 planetary nebulae, the rotation amplitude, rotation\naxis, velocity dispersion, and the total dynamical mass are determined for the\nhalo of NGC 5128. The globular cluster kinematics were searched for both radial\ndependence and metallicity dependence by subdividing the globular cluster\nsample into 158 metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0)\nglobular clusters. Our results show the kinematics of the metal-rich and\nmetal-poor subpopulations are quite similar. The kinematics are compared to the\nplanetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regions\nof the halo. The total mass of NGC 5128 is found using the Tracer Mass\nestimator (Evans et al. 2003), to determine the mass supported by internal\nrandom motions, and the spherical component of the Jeans equation to determine\nthe mass supported by rotation. We find a total mass of (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(12)\nMsun from the planetary nebulae data out to a projected radius of 90 kpc and\n(1.3+/-0.5) x 10^(12) Msun from the globular clusters out to a projected radius\nof 50 kpc. Lastly, we present a new and homogeneous catalog of known globular\nclusters in NGC 5128. This catalog combines all previous definitive cluster\nidentifications from radial velocity studies and HST imaging studies, as well\nas 80 new globular clusters from a study of M.A. Beasley et al. (2007, in\npreparation).\n"

HD 11506 is a G0V star with a planet of \\msini = 4.74 \\mjup in a\n3.85 year orbit. HD 17156 is a G0V star with a 3.12 \\mjup planet in a 21.2 day\norbit. The eccentricity of this orbit is 0.67, one of the highest known for a\nplanet with a relatively short period. The orbital period for this planet\nplaces it in a region of parameter space where relatively few planets have been\ndetected. HD 125612 is a G3V star with a planet of \\msini = 3.5 \\mjup in a 1.4\nyear orbit. HD 170469 is a G5IV star with a planet of \\msini = 0.67 \\mjup in a\n3.13 year orbit. HD 231701 is an F8V star with planet of 1.08 \\mjup in a 142\nday orbit. All of these stars have supersolar metallicity. Three of the five\nstars were observed photometrically but showed no evidence of brightness\nvariability. A transit search conducted for HD 17156 was negative but covered\nonly 25% of the search space and so is not conclusive.\n"

This paper presents a\nrecursive, vertex-splitting algorithm for calculating the hypervolume indicator\nof a set of $n$ non-comparable points in $d>2$ dimensions. It splits out\nmultiple child hyper-cuboids which can not be dominated by a splitting\nreference point. In special, the splitting reference point is carefully chosen\nto minimize the number of points in the child hyper-cuboids.

We have analyzed data\ncollected during 3.5 hours of observations conducted with the Westerbork\nSynthesis Radio Telescope operated in a tied-array mode at a frequency of 1200\nMHz. The PuMa pulsar backend provided voltage recording of X and Y linear\npolarization states in two conjugate 10 MHz bands. We restricted the time\nresolution to 4 microseconds to match the scattering on the interstellar\ninhomogeneities. In total about 18000 giant pulses (GP) were detected in full\nintensity with a threshold level of 6 sigma. Cumulative probability\ndistributions (CPD) of giant pulse energies were analyzed for groups of GPs\nwith different effective widths in the range 4 to 65 microseconds. The CPDs\nwere found to manifest notable differences for the different GP width groups.\nThe slope of a power-law fit to the high-energy portion of the CPDs evolves\nfrom -1.7 to -3.2 when going from the shortest to the longest GPs. There are\nbreaks in the CPD power-law fits indicating flattening at low energies with\nindices varying from -1.0 to -1.9 for the short and long GPs respectively. The\nGPs with a stronger peak flux density were found to be of shorter duration. We\ncompare our results with previously published data and discuss the importance\nof these peculiarities in the statistical properties of GPs for the heoretical\nunderstanding of the emission mechanism responsible for GP generation.\n"

    "abstract": "  Using a widely used stellar population synthesis model, we study the ability\nof using pairs of AB system colours to break the well-known stellar\nage--metallicity degeneracy and give constraints on the two stellar-population\nparameters (age and metallicity). The relative age and metallicity\nsensitivities of AB system colours that relate to u, B, g, V, r, R, i, I, z, J,\nH, and K bands are presented, and the abilities of various colour pairs for\nbreaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertainty\nparameter (UP) method. Our results suggest that a few pairs of colours can be\nused to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters. This will be\nvery useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In\ndetail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best\npairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. They can constrain two\nstellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89\nGyr and metallicity uncertainties less than 0.34 dex for typical uncertainties\nin colours. Some other colour pairs, such as [(R-K), (u-R)], [(I-K), (u-R)],\n[(R-K), (u-r)] and [(i-J), (u-R)], can possibly be used for constraining the\ntwo parameters, too. As a whole, our results suggest that colours relating to\nboth UBVRIJHK and ugriz magnitudes are much better than either UBVRIJHK colours\nor ugriz colours for breaking the well-known degeneracy. The results also show\nthat the stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies observed by the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) can be\nestimated via photometry data. It is also shown that the colours can be used in\nconjunction with line indices to measure stellar-population parameters.\n"

    "abstract": "  We study the possibility that the mutual interactions between Jupiter and\nSaturn prevented Type II migration from driving these planets much closer to\nthe Sun. Our work extends previous results by Masset and Snellgrove (2001), by\nexploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a\nnew hydrodynamical code that properly describes for the global viscous\nevolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and\nSaturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up\nlocked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, the\nresonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets in\nthe disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for\nthe two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration.\nIf the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or\nreversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height,\nthis mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks. We\ndiscuss the compatibility of our results with the initial conditions adopted in\nTsiganis et al. (2005) and Gomes et al. (2005) to explain the current orbital\narchitecture of the giant planets and the origin of the Late Heavy Bombardment\nof the Moon.\n"

The flexible\ndispersion management offered by PSSD enables us to independently control the\nlinear and nonlinear dispersion. Customized dispersion profiles allow us to\nanalyze the development of both carrier self-steepening and shocks. The results\nexhibit a marked asymmetry between normal and anomalous dispersion, both in the\nlimits of the shocking regime and in the (near) shocked pulse waveforms.\nCombining these insights, we offer some suggestions on how carrier shocking (or\nat least extreme self-steepening) might be realised experimentally.\n"

    "abstract": "  Six of the eight double neutron stars known in the Galactic disk have low\norbital eccentricities (< 0.27) indicating that their second-born neutron stars\nreceived only very small velocity kicks at birth. This is similar to the case\nof the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the neutron stars\nreceived hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses of\nthe second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity double\nneutron stars are remarkably low (between 1.18 and 1.30 Msun). It is argued\nthat these low-mass, low-kick neutron stars were formed by the electron-capture\ncollapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive than\nabout 3.5 Msun, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity neutron stars\nwere formed by the collapses of the iron cores of higher initial mass. The\nabsence of low-velocity single young radio pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005) is\nconsistent with the model proposed by Podsiadlowski et al. (2004), in which the\nelectron-capture collapse of degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores can only occur in binary\nsystems, and not in single stars.\n"

    "title": "The impact of radio feedback from active galactic nuclei in cosmological\n  simulations: Formation of disk galaxies",
    "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a new implementation of feedback due to active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We\nassume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is\ntransferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical\nmodel of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of\nstar-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and\ntheir central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two\ndistinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks\nand radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to\nas RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion\ndisks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We\nfind that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion\nrate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a\nRIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and\nslightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely\nhalts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a\nstochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent\nshort-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts\nseveral properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric\nluminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN\nlifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies\nand their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central\nblack hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3}, regardless of the\nstrength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback.

Single pixel observations of 10\ntransitions of HCO^+, CO and CS isotopomers were carried out, using the IRAM\n30m telescope. We studied a sample of 28 targets for which the 6.7GHz maser\nemission positions are known with a sub-arcsecond accuracy. The systemic\nvelocity inferred from the optically thin lines agrees within 3km/s with the\ncentral velocity of the maser emission for most of the sources. About 64% of\nthe sources show line wings in one or more transitions of CO, HCO^+ and CS\nspecies, indicating the presence of molecular outflows. Comparison of the\nwidths of line wings and methanol maser emission suggests that the 6.7GHz maser\nline traces the environment of MYSO of various kinematic regimes. Therefore\nconditions conducive for the methanol maser can exist in the inner parts of\nmolecular clouds or circumstellar discs as well as in the outer parts\nassociated with molecular outflows. Calculations of the physical conditions\nbased on the CO and HCO^+ lines and the CS line intensity ratios refine the\ninput parameters for maser models.\n"

    "abstract": "  The aim of this paper is to identify the young protostellar counterparts\nassociated to dust millimeter cores of the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D through\nnew IR observations (H_2 narrow-band at 2.12 micron and N broad band at 10.4\nmicron) along with an investigation performed on the existing IR catalogues.\nThe association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues\n(IRAS, MSX, 2MASS), JHK data from the literature and new observations, has been\nestablished according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectral\nenergy distributions. Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26\nunresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other\nones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H_2 jets or near-IR objects\nshowing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral\nindices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of\nClass I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0\nsources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources\nlocated inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous\nobjects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,\ntestifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.\nThe presented results reliably describe the young population of VMR-D. However,\nthe statistical evaluation of activity vs inactivity of the investigated cores,\neven in good agreement with results found for other star forming regions, seems\nto reflect the limiting sensitivity of the available facilities rather than any\nproperty intrinsic to the mm-condensations.\n"

Denoting the density matrix by $\\rho(t) =\n{1/2}, N(t) [\\1 + \\vec{\\zeta},(t) \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}, ] $, the norm of the state\n$N(t)$ is found to decrease monotonically from one to zero, while the magnitude\nof the Stokes vector $|\\vec{\\zeta},(t)|$ increases monotonically from zero to\none. This property qualifies these observables as arrows of time. Requiring\nmonotonic behaviour of $N(t)$ for arbitrary values of $\\gamma_L, \\gamma_S$ and\n$\\Delta m$ yields a bound on the CP-violating overlap $\\delta =\n\\braket{K_L},{K_S},$, which is similar to, but weaker than, the known unitarity\nbound.

We obtain the Stokes\nparameter $\\zeta_3(t)$ which shows how the average strangeness of the beam\nevolves from zero to $\\delta$. The evolution of the Stokes vector from\n$|\\vec{\\zeta},| = 0$ to $|\\vec{\\zeta},| = 1$ has a resemblance to an order\nparameter of a system undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n"

The variances of partial contributions themselves are quite\ndifferent between the smaller and the larger particles, with the larger\nparticle distribution being more correlated. The disparity in fluctuations of\npartial fill factors increases with the particle size ratio. The additional\nvariance in the partial contribution of smaller particle originates from the\nfluctuations in the size of gaps between larger particles.

    "abstract": "  High-resolution infrared spectroscopy in the 2.3-4.6 micron region is\nreported for the peculiar A supergiant, single-lined spectroscopic binary HR\n4049. Lines from the CO fundamental and first overtone, OH fundamental, and\nseveral H2O vibration-rotation transitions have been observed in the\nnear-infrared spectrum. The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emission\nthrough the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region.\nThe 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. All the\nspectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to be\ncircumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the\noxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to the\npreviously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption line\nprofiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer\nnear the dust disk. The properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk and\nthe spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, M_AI~0.58 Msolar\nand M_MV~0.34 Msolar. Gas in the disk also has an outward flow with a velocity\nof $\\gtrsim$ 1 km/s. The severe depletion of refractory elements but near-solar\nabundances of volatile elements observed in HR 4049 results from abundance\nwinnowing. The separation of the volatiles from the grains in the disk and the\nsubsequent accretion by the star are discussed. Contrary to prior reports, the\nHR 4049 carbon and oxygen isotopic abundances are typical AGB values:\n12C/13C=6^{+9},_{-4}, and 16O/17O>200.\n"

    "abstract": "  An extensive set of optical and NIR photometry and low-resolution spectra the\nType Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2003du was obtained using a number of facilities. The\nobservations started 13 days before B-band maximum light and continued for 480\ndays with exceptionally good time sampling. The optical photometry was\ncalibrated through the S-correction technique.\n  The UBVRIJHK light curves and the color indices of SN 2003du closely resemble\nthose of normal SNe Ia. SN 2003du reached a B-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)\nmag on JD2452766.38 (+/-0.5). We derive a B-band stretch parameter of 0.988\n(+/-0.003), which corresponds to dM15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a SN Ia of\nstandard luminosity. The reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by three\nmethods, and was consistently found to be negligible. We estimate a distance\nmodulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, UGC 9391. The peak UVOIR\nbolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and Arnett's rule implies\nthat M(Ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)M_sun of Ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.\nModeling of the UVOIR bolometric light curve also indicates M(Ni56) in the\nrange 0.6-0.8 M_sun. The spectral evolution of SN 2003du at both optical and\nNIR wavelengths also closely resembles normal SNe Ia. In particular, the Si II\nratio at maximum R(Si II)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of the\nblueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. The pre-maximum\nspectra of SN 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the Ca II H&K\ndoublet and infrared triplet, and possibly in Si II 6355, lines. We compare the\ntime evolution of the profiles of these lines with other well-observed SNe Ia\nand we suggest that the peculiar pre-maximum evolution of Si II 6355 line in\nmany SNe Ia is due to the presence of two blended absorption components.\n"

We\ndetected SiO towards 14 sources and suggest that the non-detections in the\nother nine sources could be due to those outflows being older and without\nongoing shocks to replenish the SiO. We serendipitously detected SO$_2$ towards\n17 sources in the same tuning as HCO$^+$. We detected HCO$^+$ towards all\nsources, and suggest that it is tracing infall in nine cases. For seven infall\ncandidates, we estimate mass infall rates between 1$\\times10^{-2},$ and\n2$\\times10^{-5},$ M$_{\\odot},$ yr$^{-1},$. Seven sources show both SiO detections\n(young outflows) and HCO$^+$ infall signatures. We also find that the abundance\nof H$^{13},$CO$^+$ tends to increase along with the abundance of SiO in sources\nfor which we could determine abundances. We discuss these results with respect\nto current theories of massive star formation via accretion. From this survey,\nwe suggest that perhaps both models of ionized accretion and halted accretion\nmay be important in describing the evolution of a massive protostar (or\nprotostars) beyond the formation of an HII region.\n"

    "abstract": "  We point out that resonance saturation in QCD can be understood in the\nlarge-Nc limit from the mathematical theory of Pade Approximants to meromorphic\nfunctions. These approximants are rational functions which encompass any\nsaturation with a finite number of resonances as a particular example,\nexplaining several results which have appeared in the literature. We review the\nmain properties of Pade Approximants with the help of a toy model for the\n<VV-AA> two-point correlator, paying particular attention to the relationship\namong the Chiral Expansion, the Operator Product Expansion and the resonance\nspectrum. In passing, we also comment on an old proposal made by Migdal in 1977\nwhich has recently attracted much attention in the context of AdS/QCD models.\nFinally, we apply the simplest Pade Approximant to the <VV-AA> correlator in\nthe real case of QCD. The general conclusion is that a rational approximant may\nreliably describe a Green's function in the Euclidean, but the same is not true\nin the Minkowski regime due to the appearance of unphysical poles and/or\nresidues.\n"

We use\nthe idea of oscillations induced by the hump of the orbital velocity profile\n(related to locally non-rotating frames - LNRF) in discs orbiting near-extreme\nKerr black holes, which are characterized by a \"humpy frequency\" f_h, that\ncould excite the radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations with frequencies\nf_r, f_v. Due to non-linear resonant phenomena the combinational frequencies\nare allowed as well. Assuming mass M=14.8M_sun and spin a=0.9998 for the GRS\n1915+105 Kerr black hole, the model predicts frequencies f_h=41Hz, f_r=67Hz,\n(f_h+f_r)=108Hz, (f_v-f_r)=170Hz corresponding quite well to the observed ones.\nFor black-hole parameters being in good agreement with those given\nobservationally, the forced resonant phenomena in non-linear oscillations,\nexcited by the \"hump-induced\" oscillations in a Keplerian disc, can explain\nhigh-frequency QPOs in GRS 1915+105 within the range of observational errors.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present numerical studies for finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE)\ndumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate\nReynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a\nset of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The\ndynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.\nMomentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an\nadditional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both\ncomponents of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way\ncoupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of\nmotion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow\nfor different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by\nWeissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in\nour study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic\nproperties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy\nbudget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to\n20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the\ndumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,\nincreasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry\nof the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the\nstreamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched\nreferentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate\nthe local dynamics and topology of the velocity gradient tensor.\n"

    "abstract": "  The Standard Model indicates the realization of grand unified structures in\nnature, and can only be viewed as an effective theory below a higher energy\ncutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating\noperators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard\nModel introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore,\nquantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating\nthat the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16},GeV. Quasi-realistic\nheterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum\ngravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation\nfor the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge\nsymmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally,\nsuch a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed\nneutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the\nelectroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These\nrequirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic\nheterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a\nU(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of\nleft-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation.\nThe existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future\nexperiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton\ndecay mediation. We further show that while the extra U(1) forbids dimension\nfour baryon number violating operators it allows dimension four lepton number\nviolating operators and R-parity violation.\n"

This is in contrast with the more\ntraditional circuit model which is based on unitary operations. Among\nmeasurement-based quantum computation methods, the recently introduced one-way\nquantum computer stands out as fundamental.\n  We develop a rigorous mathematical model underlying the one-way quantum\ncomputer and present a concrete syntax and operational semantics for programs,\nwhich we call patterns, and an algebra of these patterns derived from a\ndenotational semantics. More importantly, we present a calculus for reasoning\nlocally and compositionally about these patterns.\n  We present a rewrite theory and prove a general standardization theorem which\nallows all patterns to be put in a semantically equivalent standard form.\nStandardization has far-reaching consequences: a new physical architecture\nbased on performing all the entanglement in the beginning, parallelization by\nexposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems.\n  Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models:\nTeleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of\nthem into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory\nwe develop for the one-way model to these models. This shows that the framework\nwe have developed has a general impact on measurement-based computation and is\nnot just particular to the one-way quantum computer.\n"

    "abstract": "  There is a huge amount of historical documents in libraries and in various\nNational Archives that have not been exploited electronically. Although\nautomatic reading of complete pages remains, in most cases, a long-term\nobjective, tasks such as word spotting, text/image alignment, authentication\nand extraction of specific fields are in use today. For all these tasks, a\nmajor step is document segmentation into text lines. Because of the low quality\nand the complexity of these documents (background noise, artifacts due to\naging, interfering lines),automatic text line segmentation remains an open\nresearch field. The objective of this paper is to present a survey of existing\nmethods, developed during the last decade, and dedicated to documents of\nhistorical interest.\n"

    "title": "Phase Transitions in the Coloring of Random Graphs",
    "abstract": "  We consider the problem of coloring the vertices of a large sparse random\ngraph with a given number of colors so that no adjacent vertices have the same\ncolor. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical\nstudy of the space of proper colorings (solutions).\n  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree\n(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase\ntransitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.\nFirst, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the\nphase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond\nthis transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the\nspace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and\nconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed\none. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant\nstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is\nallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above\nthe coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the\ncritical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine\ntheir asymptotic values for large number of colors.\n  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue\nthat the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering\ntransition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the\nrelevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL\nalgorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.\n"

    "abstract": "  This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo\nOptimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning\n(PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four\ncontributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad\nclass of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application\ndomain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce\nimmediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm\nfor blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO\nproblem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two\ncontributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution\nwe validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and\nbagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures\nignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated\nvalues of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations\nare considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location\ninformation using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample\nlocations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an\nadditional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.\n"

    "abstract": "  We conduct a systematic examination of the properties of models for\nchemically homogeneous, differentially rotating, main-sequence stars of mass\n1-2 M_sun. The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of\nthe self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure\nfor a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to\nnonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities\nand effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased\npolar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on\nthe degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation\nrate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation\ngenerally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead\nto the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a\nfeature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of\ndifferentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be\nshifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in\nluminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between\nM and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results,\nincluding (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the\nproperties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a\nreduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the\nnuclear destruction of lithium and other light metallic species in the layers\nbeneath an outer convective envelope, and (iv), the excitation of solar-like\noscillations and the operation of a solar-like hydromagnetic dynamo in some\n1.5-2 M_sun stars.\n"

    "title": "Turbulent Mixing in the Surface Layers of Accreting Neutron Stars",
    "abstract": "  During accretion a neutron star (NS) is spun up as angular momentum is\ntransported through its surface layers. We study the resulting differentially\nrotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The\npredominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The\nradial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and\n~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of\ninterest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted\nangular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little\nviscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be\nrequired to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models\nillustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the\nbuoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes\nis overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or\nmay depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes\nof burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier\nelements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,\nrecurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the\nshort recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to\nexplain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second\nregime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,\nquenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst\nproperties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.\nThe carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important\nfor triggering and fueling superbursts.

The temperature and the contaminant's concentration\nfulfill convection-diffusion-reaction equations. The velocity and the pressure\nin the flow satisfy the Darcy equation, with a viscosity depending on both\nconcentration and temperature. The equations are nonlinear and strongly\ncoupled. Using both finite volume and nonconforming finite element methods, we\nintroduce a scheme adapted to this problem.

    "title": "Realizable Hamiltonians for Universal Adiabatic Quantum Computers",
    "abstract": "  It has been established that local lattice spin Hamiltonians can be used for\nuniversal adiabatic quantum computation. However, the 2-local model\nHamiltonians used in these proofs are general and hence do not limit the types\nof interactions required between spins. To address this concern, the present\npaper provides two simple model Hamiltonians that are of practical interest to\nexperimentalists working towards the realization of a universal adiabatic\nquantum computer. The model Hamiltonians presented are the simplest known\nQMA-complete 2-local Hamiltonians. The 2-local Ising model with 1-local\ntransverse field which has been realized using an array of technologies, is\nperhaps the simplest quantum spin model but is unlikely to be universal for\nadiabatic quantum computation. We demonstrate that this model can be rendered\nuniversal and QMA-complete by adding a tunable 2-local transverse XX coupling.\nWe also show the universality and QMA-completeness of spin models with only\n1-local Z and X fields and 2-local ZX interactions.\n"

The isospin\nchemical potential is obtained by giving a vev to the time component of the\nnon-Abelian gauge field on the brane. The fluctuations of the non-Abelian gauge\nfield on the brane are dual to the SU(2) flavor current in the field theory.\nFor the embedding corresponding to vanishing quark mass, we calculate all Green\nfunctions corresponding to the components of the flavor current correlator. We\ndiscuss the physical properties of these Green functions, which go beyond\nlinear response theory. In particular, we show that the isospin chemical\npotential leads to a frequency-dependent isospin diffusion coefficient.\n"

It is shown that the\napparent contradiction between the two incompatible normalization conditions\nwith finite and singular behavior in the EP-limit can be resolved by\nprojectively extending the original Hilbert space. The complementary\nnormalization conditions correspond then to two different affine charts of this\nenlarged projective Hilbert space.

To date however, there is no structured\nprocess (at least in the public domain) that guides organizations in adopting\nagile practices. To address this problem we present the Agile Adoption\nFramework. The framework consists of two components: an agile measurement\nindex, and a 4-Stage process, that together guide and assist the agile adoption\nefforts of organizations. More specifically, the agile measurement index is\nused to identify the agile potential of projects and organizations. The 4-Stage\nprocess, on the other hand, helps determine (a) whether or not organizations\nare ready for agile adoption, and (b) guided by their potential, what set of\nagile practices can and should be introduced.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present the results of a detailed spectral and temporal analysis of Swift\nand XMM-Newton observations of the high redshift (z=3.969) GRB 050730. The\nX-ray afterglow of GRB 050730 was found to decline with time with superimposed\nintense flaring activity that extended over more than two orders of magnitude\nin time. Seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ks\nafter the burst were observed. The underlying decay of the afterglow was well\ndescribed by a double broken power-law model with breaks at t_1= 237 +/- 20 s\nand t_2 = 10.1 (-2.2) (+4.6) ks. The temporal decay slopes before, between and\nafter these breaks were alpha_1 = 2.1 +/- 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.44 (-0.08) (+0.14)\nand alpha_3 = 2.40 (+0.07) (-0.09), respectively. The spectrum of the X-ray\nafterglow was well described by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with an\nabsorbing column density N_H=(1.28 +/- 0.26) 10^22 cm^-2 in the host galaxy.\nStrong X-ray spectral evolution during the flaring activity was present. In the\nmajority of the flares (6/7) the ratio Delta_t/t_p between the duration of the\nevent and the time when the flare peaks was nearly constant and about 0.6-0.7.\nWe showed that the observed spectral and temporal properties of the first three\nflares are consistent with being due both to high-latitude emission, as\nexpected if the flares were produced by late internal shocks, or to refreshed\nshocks, i.e. late time energy injections into the main afterglow shock by slow\nmoving shells ejected from the central engine during the prompt phase. The\nevent fully satisfies the E_p-E_iso Amati relation while is not consistent with\nthe E_p-E_jet Ghirlanda relation.\n"

The IR through mm\nspectral energy distribution can be approximated by a two-temperature model (25\nand 63 K) with a total luminosity of approximately log(L/Lsun)=5.2. Previous\nsubmm imaging resolved this region into a cluster of 5 dust cores, one of which\nis associated with the UCHII region G23.96+0.15, and another with an H2O maser.\nIn our new 2.7 mm continuum image, only the UCHII region is detected, with\ntotal flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in VLA\ncm-wave maps. For the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and in\nthe MSX mid-IR bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperature\nof 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish and\ninterferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O cores\nin this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present. While\nthe overall extent of the C18O and dust emission is similar, the emission peaks\ndo not correlate well in detail. At least 11 of the 123 stars identified by\n2MASS in this region are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. Two\nstars (both associated with the UCHII region) were previously identified as O\nstars via IR spectroscopy. Most of the rest of the reddened stars have no\nobvious correlation with the C18O cores or the dust cores. In summary, our\nobservations indicate that considerable fragmentation of the molecular cloud\nhas taken place during the time required for the UCHII region to form and the O\nstars to become detectable at IR wavelengths. Additional star formation appears\nto be ongoing on the periphery of the central region, where up to four B-type\n(proto)stars have formed among a substantial number of C18O molecular cores.\n"

    "abstract": "  We report infrared photometry of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b during the\ntime of secondary eclipse (planet passing behind the star). Observations were\nacquired during two secondary eclipses at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility\n(IRTF) in September 2003. We used a circular variable filter (1.5-percent\nbandpass) centered at 3.8 microns to isolate the predicted flux peak of the\nplanet at this wavelength. Residual telluric absorption and instrument\nvariations were removed by offsetting the telescope to nearby bright comparison\nstars at a high temporal cadence. Our results give a secondary eclipse depth of\n0.0013 +/- 0.0011, not yet sufficient precision to detect the eclipse, whose\nexpected depth is approximately 0.002 - 0.003. We here elucidate the current\nobservational limitations to this technique, and discuss the approach needed to\nachieve detections of hot Jupiter secondary eclipses at 3.8 microns from the\nground.\n"

    "abstract": "  A multiple antenna downlink channel where limited channel feedback is\navailable to the transmitter is considered. In a vector downlink channel\n(single antenna at each receiver), the transmit antenna array can be used to\ntransmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter\nhas very accurate channel knowledge, i.e., if there is high-rate channel\nfeedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback\nrequirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number\nof antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method\nthat minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby\nminimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is\nshown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining\nbecause minimization of interference power is more critical than maximization\nof signal power in the multiple antenna downlink. Analysis is provided to\nquantify the feedback savings, and the technique is seen to work well with user\nselection and is also robust to receiver estimation error.\n"

The non-linearities\nappear both as additive drift terms and as multipliers of the noise. Using\ntechniques of Malliavin calculus, we establish upper and lower bounds on the\none-point density of the solution u(t,x), and upper bounds of Gaussian-type on\nthe two-point density of (u(s,y),u(t,x)). In particular, this estimate\nquantifies how this density degenerates as (s,y) converges to (t,x). From these\nresults, we deduce upper and lower bounds on hitting probabilities of the\nprocess {u(t,x)},_{t \\in \\mathbb{R},_+, x \\in [0,1]},, in terms of respectively\nHausdorff measure and Newtonian capacity. These estimates make it possible to\nshow that points are polar when d >6 and are not polar when d<6. We also show\nthat the Hausdorff dimension of the range of the process is 6 when d>6, and\ngive analogous results for the processes t \\mapsto u(t,x) and x \\mapsto u(t,x).\nFinally, we obtain the values of the Hausdorff dimensions of the level sets of\nthese processes.\n"

HI emission at a velocity of -117\nkm/s towards the sightline HD 30677 with NHI=1.7x10^19 cm-2 has no\ncorresponding CaII K absorption, which has a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of\n610. The star has a spectroscopically determined distance of 2.7-kpc, and hence\nsets this as a firm lower distance limit towards Anti-Centre cloud ACII.\nTowards another sightline (HD 46185), HI at +122 km/s and NHI=1.2x10^19 cm-2 is\nseen. The CaII K spectrum has a S/N = 780, although no absorption is observed\nat the cloud velocity. This similarly places a firm lower distance limit of\n2.9-kpc towards this parcel of gas that may be an intermediate velocity cloud.\nThe lack of intermediate velocity (IV) CaII K absorption towards HD 196426 at a\nS/N = 500 reinforces a lower distance limit of 700-pc towards this part of\nComplex gp, where NHI is 1.1x10^19 cm-2 and velocity is +78 km/s. Additionally,\nno IV CaII K is seen in absorption in the spectrum of HD 19445, which is strong\nin HI with NHI=8x10^19 cm-2 at -42 km/s, placing a firm although uninteresting\nlower distance limit of 39-pc to this part of IV South. Finally, no HV CaII K\nabsorption is seen towards HD 115363 at a S/N = 410, placing a lower distance\nof 3.2-kpc towards the HVC gas at velocity of +224 km/s and NHI=5.2x10^19 cm-2.\nThis gas is in the same region of the sky as complex WE (Wakker 2001), but at\nhigher velocities. The non-detection of CaII K absorption sets a lower distance\nof 3.2-kpc towards the HVC, which is unsurprising if this feature is indeed\nrelated to the Magellanic System.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present a deep photometric survey of M31, conducted with the CFHT and INT,\ncovering the inner 50 kpc of the galaxy, the Southern quadrant out to 150 kpc,\nand extending to M33. This is the first systematic panoramic study of this very\noutermost region of galaxies. We detect several streams and other large-scale\nstructures, and two new dwarf galaxies: And XV and XVI. The discovery of\nsubstructure on the minor axis, together with the fact that the light profile\nbetween 0.5 < R < 1.3 follows the exponential ``extended disk'', is\nparticularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting\nresults reported in previous studies. Underlying the substructures lies a\nfaint, metal-poor, smooth and extremely extended halo, reaching out to at least\n150 kpc. The smooth halo component in M31 has a profile that can be fit with a\nHernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 larger\nthan theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +/-\n0.11 can be fit to the profile. The total luminosity of this structure is\nsimilar to that of the halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying\nhalo is reminiscent of a classical monolithic model and completely unexpected\nfrom modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended\nmetal-poor halo component, which can be fit with a Hernquist model also of\nscale radius ~55 kpc. These extended slowly-decreasing halos will provide a\nchallenge and strong constraints for further modeling. [Abridged]\n"

    "abstract": "  One of the goals of the landscape program in string theory is to extract\ninformation about the space of string vacua in the form of statistical\ncorrelations between phenomenological features that are otherwise uncorrelated\nin field theory. Such correlations would thus represent predictions of string\ntheory that hold independently of a vacuum-selection principle. In this paper,\nwe study statistical correlations between two features which are likely to be\ncentral to any potential description of nature at high energy scales: gauge\nsymmetries and spacetime supersymmetry. We analyze correlations between these\ntwo kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic string\nvacua, and find a number of striking features. We find, for example, that the\ndegree of spacetime supersymmetry is strongly correlated with the probabilities\nof realizing certain gauge groups, with unbroken supersymmetry at the string\nscale tending to favor gauge-group factors with larger rank. We also find that\nnearly half of the heterotic landscape is non-supersymmetric and yet\ntachyon-free at tree level; indeed, less than a quarter of the tree-level\nheterotic landscape exhibits any supersymmetry at all at the string scale.\n"

    "title": "Identifying Dark Matter Burners in the Galactic center",
    "abstract": "  If the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our Galaxy grew\nadiabatically, then a dense \"spike\" of dark matter is expected to have formed\naround it. Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH\ncan capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to\nannihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even\nexceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus\npredicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. \"WIMP burners\", in the vicinity\nof an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners\nare stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate\ncores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the\nexistence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its\ndensity profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP\nburning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core\nmasses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the\nobserved stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be\nconsistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We\nalso cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of\ngamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark\nmatter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the\nEGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision\nmeasurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matter\nspike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringent\nlimits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.\n"

    "title": "Instabilities in the time-dependent neutrino disc in Gamma-Ray Bursts",
    "abstract": "  We investigate the properties and evolution of accretion tori formed after\nthe coalescence of two compact objects. At these extreme densities and\ntemperatures, the accreting torus is cooled mainly by neutrino emission\nproduced primarily by electron and positron capture on nucleons (beta\nreactions). We solve for the disc structure and its time evolution by\nintroducing a detailed treatment of the equation of state which includes\nphotodisintegration of helium, the condition of beta-equilibrium, and neutrino\nopacities. We self-consistently calculate the chemical equilibrium in the gas\nconsisting of helium, free protons, neutrons and electron-positron pairs and\ncompute the chemical potentials of the species, as well as the electron\nfraction throughout the disc. We find that, for sufficiently large accretion\nrates (> 10 solar masses per second), the inner regions of the disk become\nopaque and develop a viscous and thermal instability. The identification of\nthis instability might be relevant for GRB observations.\n"

    "abstract": "  Diffuse emission is produced in energetic cosmic ray (CR) interactions,\nmainly protons and electrons, with the interstellar gas and radiation field and\ncontains the information about particle spectra in distant regions of the\nGalaxy. It may also contain information about exotic processes such as dark\nmatter annihilation, black hole evaporation etc. A model of the diffuse\nemission is important for determination of the source positions and spectra.\nCalculation of the Galactic diffuse continuum gamma-ray emission requires a\nmodel for CR propagation as the first step. Such a model is based on theory of\nparticle transport in the interstellar medium as well as on many kinds of data\nprovided by different experiments in Astrophysics and Particle and Nuclear\nPhysics. Such data include: secondary particle and isotopic production cross\nsections, total interaction nuclear cross sections and lifetimes of radioactive\nspecies, gas mass calibrations and gas distribution in the Galaxy (H_2, H I, H\nII), interstellar radiation field, CR source distribution and particle spectra\nat the sources, magnetic field, energy losses, gamma-ray and synchrotron\nproduction mechanisms, and many other issues. We are continuously improving the\nGALPROP model and the code to keep up with a flow of new data. Improvement in\nany field may affect the Galactic diffuse continuum gamma-ray emission model\nused as a background model by the GLAST LAT instrument. Here we report about\nthe latest improvements of the GALPROP and the diffuse emission model.\n"

    "title": "Prompt Emission of High Energy Photons from Gamma Ray Bursts",
    "abstract": "  Within the internal shock scenario we consider different mechanisms of high\nenergy ($>1$ MeV) photon production inside a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) fireball and\nderive the expected high energy photon spectra from individual GRBs during the\nprompt phase. The photon spectra of leptonic and hadronic origins are compared\nwithin different sets of parameter regimes. Our results suggest that the high\nenergy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shock\nenergy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\\epsilon_e > 10^{-3},$).\nFor very small values of $\\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could be\ncomparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime.\nHowever, in this case a much larger energy budget of the fireball is required\nto account for the same level of the observed sub-MeV spectrum. The fireballs\nare therefore extremely inefficient in radiation. For a canonical fireball bulk\nLorentz factor (e.g. $\\Gamma=400$), emissions above $\\sim 10$ GeV are\nattenuated by two-photon pair production processes. For a fireball with an even\nhigher Lorentz factor, the cutoff energy is higher, and emissions of 10 TeV -\nPeV due to $\\pi^0$-decay can also escape from the internal shocks. The flux\nlevel is however too low to be detected by current TeV detectors, and these\nphotons also suffer attenuation by external soft photons.\n"

The calculation is performed using\nthe Lorentz integral transform method along with the {\\em ab initio}, no-core\nshell model approach. An important feature of the present study is the\nconsistency of the NN and NNN interactions and also, through the Siegert\ntheorem, of the two- and three-body current operators. This is due to the\napplication of the $\\chi$EFT framework. The inclusion of the NNN interaction\nproduces a suppression of the low-energy peak and enhancement of the\nhigh-energy tail of the cross section. We compare to calculations obtained\nusing other interactions and to representative experiments. The rather confused\nexperimental situation in the giant resonance region prevents discrimination\namong different interaction models.\n"

For the $H\\to WW$\nmode, the acceptance rates of the signal events predicted by the resummation\nand NLO calculations are almost the same, but some of the predicted kinematical\ndistributions are quite different.

    "abstract": "  In the previous study (Hiremath 2006a), the solar cycle is modeled as a\nforced and damped harmonic oscillator and from all the 22 cycles (1755-1996),\nlong-term amplitudes, frequencies, phases and decay factor are obtained. Using\nthese physical parameters of the previous 22 solar cycles and by an {\\em\nautoregressive model},, we predict the amplitude and period of the future\nfifteen solar cycles. Predicted amplitude of the present solar cycle (23)\nmatches very well with the observations. The period of the present cycle is\nfound to be 11.73 years. With these encouraging results, we also predict the\nprofiles of future 15 solar cycles. Important predictions are : (i) the period\nand amplitude of the cycle 24 are 9.34 years and 110 ($\\pm 11$), (ii) the\nperiod and amplitude of the cycle 25 are 12.49 years and 110 ($\\pm$ 11), (iii)\nduring the cycles 26 (2030-2042 AD), 27 (2042-2054 AD), 34 (2118-2127 AD), 37\n(2152-2163 AD) and 38 (2163-2176 AD), the sun might experience a very high\nsunspot activity, (iv) the sun might also experience a very low (around 60)\nsunspot activity during cycle 31 (2089-2100 AD) and, (v) length of the solar\ncycles vary from 8.65 yrs for the cycle 33 to maximum of 13.07 yrs for the\ncycle 35.\n"

We find physical reasons to formal problems with\nnon-commutative gauge theories such as the issue with SU(N) gauge symmetries.\nOur construction is applied to a minimal extension of the standard model. It is\nshown that the Higgs sector might be non-commutative whereas the remaining\nsectors of the standard model remain commutative. Signatures of this model at\nthe LHC are discussed. We then discuss an application to a dark matter sector\ncoupled to the Higgs sector of the standard model and show that here again,\ndark matter could be non-commutative, the standard model fields remaining\ncommutative.\n"

The Johari-Goldstein peaks,\nseen in four of our seven cases, are describable in terms of gaussians in the\nbarrier density, superimposed on the high-frequency tail of the\n$\\alpha$-process.

The scheme assumes that the system can be represented by\na combination of components of only two different types: first-order low-pass\nfilters and static nonlinearities.

Several examples taken from neuroscience\nare given: phototransduction, photopigment bleaching, and spike generation\naccording to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. The scheme uses two slightly\ndifferent forms of autoregressive filters, with an implicit delay of zero for\nfeedforward control and an implicit delay of half a sample distance for\nfeedback control. On a fairly complex model of the macaque retinal horizontal\ncell it computes, for a given level of accuracy, 1-2 orders of magnitude faster\nthan 4th-order Runge-Kutta.

While our sample is\ndefinitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy,\nit does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow\nfor simple statistical considerations. BV wide-field CCD photometry was\nobtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical\nevolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were\ndetermined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and\ndistances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass\nfunction was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation\neffect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. This study\nreports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42\nobserved open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed\nclusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate.\nThe core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is\n3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's\nmass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical\nevolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is\nsimilar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of\nevaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass\nsegregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the\ndynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log(age)=8.\nLow-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log(age)=8.5\nand not younger than one relaxation time.\n"

With the knowledge of the\nhost star's physical parameters, the planetary radius can be determined.\nCombined with spectroscopic observations the mass and therefore the density can\nbe derived from Doppler-measurements. Depending on the brightness of the host\nstar, additional information, e. g. about the spin-orbit alignment between the\nhost star and planetary orbit, can be obtained.\n  Aims: The last few years have witnessed a growing success of transit surveys.\nAmong other surveys, the MACHO project provided nine potential transiting\nplanets, several of them with relatively bright parent stars. The photometric\nsignature of a transit event is, however, insufficient to confirm the planetary\nnature of the faint companion. The aim of this paper therefore is a\ndetermination of the spectroscopic parameters of the host stars as well as a\ndynamical mass determination through Doppler-measurements.\n  Methods: We have obtained follow-up high-resolution spectra for five stars\nselected from the MACHO sample, which are consistent with transits of\nlow-luminosity objects. Radial velocities have been determined by means of\ncross-correlation with model spectra. The MACHO light curves have been compared\nto simulations based on the physical parameters of the system derived from the\nradial velocities and spectral analyses.\n  Aims: We show that all transit light curves of the exoplanet candidates\nanalysed in this work can be explained by eclipses of stellar objects, hence\nnone of the five transiting objects is a planet.\n"

    "title": "Anisotropy and Magnetic Field Effects on the Genuine Multipartite\n  Entanglement of Multi-Qubit Heisenberg {\\it XY}, Chains",
    "abstract": "  It has been shown that, for the two-qubit Heisenberg XY model, anisotropy and\nmagnetic field may together be used to produce entanglement for any finite\ntemperature by adjusting the external magnetic field beyond some finite\ncritical strength. This interesting result arises from an analysis employing\nthe Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubit\nstates. Recently, Mintert {\\em et al.}, proposed generalizations of Wootters\nconcurrence for multipartite states. These MKB concurrences possess a\nmathematical property that enables one to understand the origin of this\ncharacteristic behavior. Here, we first study the effect of anisotropy and\nmagnetic field on the multipartite thermal entanglement of a four-qubit\nHeisenberg XY chain using the MKB concurrences. We show that this model\nexhibits characteristic behavior similar to that of the two-qubit model. In\naddition, we show that this can again be understood using the same mathematical\nproperty. Next, we show that the six-qubit Heisenberg XY chain possesses\nproperties necessary for it to have the characteristic behavior too. Most\nimportantly, it is possible to directly measure the multipartite MKB\nconcurrences of pure states. This may provide an experimental verification of\nour conjecture that for a Heisenberg XY chain of any even number of qubits, it\nis always possible to obtain non-zero genuine multipartite entanglement at any\nfinite temperature by applying a sufficiently large magnetic field.\n"

    "abstract": "  The secure and robust functioning of a network relies on the defect-free\nimplementation of network applications. As network protocols have become\nincreasingly complex, however, hand-writing network message processing code has\nbecome increasingly error-prone. In this paper, we present a domain-specific\nlanguage, Zebu, for describing protocol message formats and related processing\nconstraints. From a Zebu specification, a compiler automatically generates\nstubs to be used by an application to parse network messages. Zebu is easy to\nuse, as it builds on notations used in RFCs to describe protocol grammars. Zebu\nis also efficient, as the memory usage is tailored to application needs and\nmessage fragments can be specified to be processed on demand. Finally,\nZebu-based applications are robust, as the Zebu compiler automatically checks\nspecification consistency and generates parsing stubs that include validation\nof the message structure. Using a mutation analysis in the context of SIP and\nRTSP, we show that Zebu significantly improves application robustness.\n"

    "abstract": "  We analyse star formation in the nuclei of 9 Seyfert galaxies at spatial\nresolutions down to 0.085arcsec, corresponding to length scales of less than\n10pc in some objects. Our data were taken mostly with the near infrared\nadaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles\ntypically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. In two cases there is\nunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In the\nnuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -\nstarbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a few\npercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the\nluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a\nsimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to\n10^{13},L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density\nexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limited\nand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur in\nmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onset\nof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whether\nthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play in\nfuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds and\nsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.\nOn the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,\nand they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.\n"

A real circle can be defined as the image of\nthe real axis under a Moebius transformation in the complex field. Likewise,\nand roughly speaking, a hypercircle can be defined as the image of a line (\"the\n${\\mathbb{K},},$-axis\") in a $n$-degree finite algebraic extension\n$\\mathbb{K},(\\alpha)\\thickapprox\\mathbb{K},^n$ under the transformation\n$\\frac{at+b},{ct+d},:\\mathbb{K},(\\alpha)\\to\\mathbb{K},(\\alpha)$.\n  The aim of this article is to extend, to the case of hypercircles, some of\nthe specific properties of circles. We show that hypercircles are precisely,\nvia $\\mathbb{K},$-projective transformations, the rational normal curve of a\nsuitable degree. We also obtain a complete description of the points at\ninfinity of these curves (generalizing the cyclic structure at infinity of\ncircles). We characterize hypercircles as those curves of degree equal to the\ndimension of the ambient affine space and with infinitely many\n${\\mathbb{K},},$-rational points, passing through these points at infinity.\nMoreover, we give explicit formulae for the parametrization and implicitation\nof hypercircles. Besides the intrinsic interest of this very special family of\ncurves, the understanding of its properties has a direct application to the\nsimplification of parametrizations problem, as shown in the last section.\n"

    "abstract": "  We make a systematic analysis of the XMM-Newton X-ray spectra of intermediate\npolars (IPs) and find that, contrary to the traditional picture, most show a\nsoft blackbody component. We compare the results with those from AM Her stars\nand deduce that the blackbody emission arises from reprocessing of hard X-rays,\nrather than from the blobby accretion sometimes seen in AM Hers. Whether an IP\nshows a blackbody component appears to depend primarily on geometric factors: a\nblackbody is not seen in those that have accretion footprints that are always\nobscured by accretion curtains or are only visible when foreshortened on the\nwhite-dwarf limb. Thus we argue against previous suggestions that the blackbody\nemission characterises a separate sub-group of IPs which are more akin to AM\nHers, and develop a unified picture of the blackbody emission in these stars.\n"

    "abstract": "  By combining high-resolution (HST-WFPC2) and wide-field ground based (2.2m\nESO-WFI) and space (GALEX) observations, we have collected a multi-wavelength\nphotometric data base (ranging from the far UV to the near infrared) of the\ngalactic globular cluster NGC1904 (M79). The sample covers the entire cluster\nextension, from the very central regions up to the tidal radius. In the present\npaper such a data set is used to study the BSS population and its radial\ndistribution. A total number of 39 bright ($m_{218},\\le 19.5$) BSS has been\ndetected, and they have been found to be highly segregated in the cluster core.\nNo significant upturn in the BSS frequency has been observed in the outskirts\nof NGC 1904, in contrast to other clusters (M 3, 47 Tuc, NGC 6752, M 5) studied\nwith the same technique. Such evidences, coupled with the large radius of\navoidance estimated for NGC 1904 ($r_{avoid},\\sim 30$ core radii), indicate that\nthe vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to the\ncore. Accordingly, extensive dynamical simulations suggest that BSS formed by\nmass transfer activity in primordial binaries evolving in isolation in the\ncluster outskirts represent only a negligible (0--10%) fraction of the overall\npopulation.\n"

We show a detailed analysis of both heavy and light\nHiggses decay and production in addition to the possible decay channels of the\nnew gauge boson. We find that the cross sections of the SM-like Higgs\nproduction are reduced by ~ 20%-30%, while its decay branching ratios remain\nintact. The extra Higgs has relatively small cross sections and the branching\nratios of Z'-> l^+ l^- are of order ~20% compared to ~ 3% of the SM resuls.\nHence, the search for Z' is accessible via a clean dilepton signal at LHC.\n"

    "abstract": "  In the canonical formalism of statistical physics, a signature of a first\norder phase transition for finite systems is the bimodal distribution of an\norder parameter. Previous thermodynamical studies of nuclear sources produced\nin heavy-ion collisions provide information which support the existence of a\nphase transition in those finite nuclear systems. Some results suggest that the\nobservable Z1 (charge of the biggest fragment) can be considered as a reliable\norder parameter of the transition. This talk will show how from peripheral\ncollisions studied with the INDRA detector at GSI we can obtain this bimodal\nbehaviour of Z1. Getting rid of the entrance channel effects and under the\nconstraint of an equiprobable distribution of excitation energy (E*), we use\nthe canonical description of a phase transition to link this bimodal behaviour\nwith the residual convexity of the entropy. Theoretical (with and without phase\ntransition) and experimental Z1-E* correlations are compared. This comparison\nallows us to rule out the case without transition. Moreover that quantitative\ncomparison provides us with information about the coexistence region in the\nZ1-E* plane which is in good agreement with that obtained with the signal of\nabnormal uctuations of configurational energy (microcanonical negative heat\ncapacity).\n"

    "abstract": "  To use galaxy clusters as a cosmological probe, it is important to account\nfor their triaxiality. Assuming that the triaxial shapes of galaxy clusters are\ninduced by the tidal interaction with the surrounding matter, Lee and Kang\nrecently developed a reconstruction algorithm for the measurement of the axial\nratio of a triaxial cluster. We examine the validity of this reconstruction\nalgorithm by performing an observational test of it with the Virgo cluster as a\ntarget. We first modify the LK06 algorithm by incorporating the two dimensional\nprojection effect. Then, we analyze the 1275 member galaxies from the Virgo\nCluster Catalogue and find the projected direction of the Virgo cluster major\naxis by measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the member\ngalaxies in the two dimensional projected plane. Applying the modified\nreconstruction algorithm to the analyzed data, we find that the axial ratio of\nthe triaxial Virgo cluster is (1: 0.54 : 0.73). This result is consistent with\nthe recent observational report from the Virgo Cluster Survey, proving the\nrobustness of the reconstruction algorithm. It is also found that at the inner\nradii the shape tends to be more like prolate. We discuss the possible effect\nof the Virgo cluster triaxiality on the mass estimation.\n"

    "title": "QCD thermodynamics and confinement from a dynamical quasiparticle point\n  of view",
    "abstract": "  In this study it is demonstrated that a simple picture of the\n  QCD gluon liquid emerges in the dynamical quasiparticle model that specifies\nthe active degrees of freedom in the time-like sector and yields a potential\nenergy density in the space-like sector. By using the time-like gluon density\n(or scalar gluon density) as an independent degree of freedom - instead of the\ntemperature $T$ as a Lagrange parameter - variations of the potential energy\ndensity lead to effective mean-fields for time-like gluons and an effective\ngluon-gluon interaction strength at low density. The latter yields a simple\ndynamical picture for the gluon fusion to color neutral glueballs when\napproaching the phase boundary from a temperature higher than $T_c$ and paves\nthe way for an off-shell transport theoretical description of the parton\ndynamics.\n"

    "abstract": "  Ebert et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3827 (1996)] have fractured icosahedral\nAl-Mn-Pd single crystals in ultrahigh vacuum and have investigated the cleavage\nplanes in-situ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Globular patterns in the\nSTM-images were interpreted as clusters of atoms. These are significant\nstructural units of quasicrystals. The experiments of Ebert et al. imply that\nthey are also stable physical entities, a property controversially discussed\ncurrently. For a clarification we performed the first large scale fracture\nsimulations on three-dimensional complex binary systems. We studied the\npropagation of mode I cracks in an icosahedral model quasicrystal by molecular\ndynamics techniques at low temperature. In particular we examined how the shape\nof the cleavage plane is influenced by the clusters inherent in the model and\nhow it depends on the plane structure. Brittle fracture with no indication of\ndislocation activity is observed. The crack surfaces are rough on the scale of\nthe clusters, but exhibit constant average heights for orientations\nperpendicular to high symmetry axes. From detailed analyses of the fractured\nsamples we conclude that both, the plane structure and the clusters, strongly\ninfluence dynamic fracture in quasicrystals and that the clusters therefore\nhave to be regarded as physical entities.\n"

    "abstract": "  The paper is considering an opportunity for the CERN/GranSasso (CNGS)\nneutrino complex, concurrent time-wise with T2K and NOvA, to search for\ntheta_13 oscillations and CP violation. Compared with large water Cherenkov\n(T2K) and fine grained scintillators (NOvA), the LAr-TPC offers a higher\ndetection efficiency and a lower backgrounds, since virtually all channels may\nbe unambiguously recognized. The present proposal, called MODULAr, describes a\n20 kt fiducial volume LAr-TPC, following very closely the technology developed\nfor the ICARUS-T60o, and is focused on the following activities, for which we\nseek an extended international collaboration:\n  (1) the neutrino beam from the CERN 400 GeV proton beam and an optimised horn\nfocussing, eventually with an increased intensity in the framework of the LHC\naccelerator improvement program;\n  (2) A new experimental area LNGS-B, of at least 50000 m3 at 10 km off-axis\nfrom the main Laboratory, eventually upgradable to larger sizes. A location is\nunder consideration at about 1.2 km equivalent water depth;\n  (3) A new LAr Imaging detector of at least 20 kt fiducial mass. Such an\nincrease in the volume over the current ICARUS T600 needs to be carefully\nconsidered. It is concluded that a very large mass is best realised with a set\nof many identical, independent units, each of 5 kt, \"cloning\" the technology of\nthe T600. Further phases may foresee extensions of MODULAr to meet future\nphysics goals.\n  The experiment might reasonably be operational in about 4/5 years, provided a\nnew hall is excavated in the vicinity of the Gran Sasso Laboratory and adequate\nfunding and participation are made available.\n"

Electron and ion momentum\ndistributions after double ionization of a model Helium atom in a strong\nfew-cycle laser pulse are studied. We show that, in this case, the choice of\nsuitable functionals for the observables is considerably more important than\nthe choice of the correlation potential in the time-dependent Kohn-Sham\nequations. By comparison with the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger\nequation, the insufficiency of functionals neglecting electron correlation is\ndemonstrated. We construct a functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, which in\nprinciple yields the exact momentum distributions of the electrons and the ion.\nThe product-phase approximation is introduced, which reduces the problem of\napproximating this functional significantly.\n"

It is possible that the $H_{c2},(T)$\nanomalies are due to the presence of inhomogeneities in the local charge\ncarrier density $\\rho$ of the $CuO_2$ planes. In order to study this point, we\nhave prepared good quality samples of polycrystalline $La_{2-x},Sr_xCuO_{4},$\nusing the wet-chemical method, which has demonstrated to produce samples with a\nbetter cation distribution. In particular, we have studied the temperature\ndependence of the second critical field, $H_{c2},(T)$, through the magnetization\nmeasurements on two samples with opposite average carrier concentration\n($\\rho_m=x$) and nearly the same critical temperature, namely $\\rho_m = 0.08$\n(underdoped) and $\\rho_m = 0.25$ (overdoped). The results close to $T_c$ do not\nfollow the usual Ginzburg-Landau theory and are interpreted by a theory which\ntakes into account the influence of the inhomogeneities.\n"

    "abstract": "  Abridged... Blue stragglers (BSS) are thought to be the product of either\nprimordial or collisional binary systems. In the context of dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine BSS population from young\nmain sequence (MS) stars tracing a ~1-2 Gyr old star forming episode. Assuming\nthat their blue plume populations are made of BSS, we estimate the BSS\nfrequency for 8 Local Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using a\ncompilation of ground and space based photometry.\n  Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) The BSS frequency in dwarf\ngalaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of\nsimilar luminosities; (ii) the BSS frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf\ngalaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo;\nand most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significant\nanti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv.\n  The low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxy\nsample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) a\nnegligible production of collisional BSS; and consequently (iii) that their\nblue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. The dwarf galaxies\nanti-correlation can be used as a discriminator: galaxies obeying the\nanti-correlation are more likely to possess genuine primordial BSS rather than\nyoung main sequence stars.\n"

    "abstract": "  We study the properties of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet with spatially\nanisotropic nearest-neighbour exchange couplings on the kagome net, i.e. with\ncoupling J in one lattice direction and couplings J' along the other two\ndirections. For J/J' > 1, this model is believed to describe the magnetic\nproperties of the mineral volborthite. In the classical limit, it exhibits two\nkinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J/J' < 1/2 and a large\nmanifold of canted spin states for J/J' > 1/2. To include quantum effects\nself-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of the\noriginal SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to the\ndependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameter\nkappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numerical\ncalculations reveal that in the kappa-J/J' plane, the system shows a rich phase\ndiagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and a\ndecoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. We\ncorroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the various\nphases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determined\nby analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spin\nperturbation expansion to the trimerised version of the original spin-1/2 model\nleads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J/J' >> 1, the\nground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet,\nwhich is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition.\n"

The distribution function has a $\\delta$-like\nsingularity at the Fermi momentum $k_F$. The Fourier spectrum of the density\nhas a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with the harmonics being absent\nor vanishing above this threshold. These features are found by calculations\nusing exact diagonalization method. They are shown to be caused by Wigner\nordering of electrons, affected by the boundaries. However the common Luttinger\nliquid model with open boundaries fails to capture these features, because it\noverestimates the deformation of the Wigner crystal.

    "abstract": "  In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the\nintrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly\noriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.\nHowever, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of\ntheories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates\na significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action\nequals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple\nto a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB\ngyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the\nEarth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not\napply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the\nHayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called\nEinstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of\nthis theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for\nthe torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with\nthe spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either\nghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems\ncan be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition\nchoosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This\nyields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction\nprinciple is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does\nnot couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji\ntheory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There\nmay be other torsion theories which do.\n"

The images show many\ndifferent structures indicating that star formation is going on in the most\npart of the disk. NGC 3367 is known to have a very high concentration of\nmolecular gas distribution in the central regions of the galaxy and bipolar\nsynchrotron emission from the nucleus with two lobes (at 6 kpc) forming a\ntriple structure similar to a radio galaxy. We have determined the U, B, V, R,\nand I magnitudes and U - B, B - V, U - V, and V - I colors for the central\nregion (nucleus), a region which includes supernovae 2003 AA, and 79 star\nassociations throughout NGC 3367. Estimation of ages of star associations is\nvery difficult due to several factors, among them: filling factor, metallicity,\nspatial distribution of each structure and the fact that we estimated the\nmagnitudes with a circular aperture of 16 pixels in diameter, equivalent to\n$6''.8\\sim1.4$ kpc. However, if the colors derived for NGC 3367 were similar to\nthe colors expected of star clusters with theoretical evolutionary star tracks\ndeveloped for the LMC and had a similar metallicity, NGC 3367 show 51 percent\nof the observed structures with age type SWB I (few tens of Myrs), with seven\nsources outside the bright surface brightness visible disk of NGC 3367.\n"

For the validation of the algorithms, results for the harmonic\nperiodic chain are presented. We then study the Fibonacci chain with harmonic\nand anharmonic interaction potentials. In the dynamic Fibonacci chain\nneighboring atoms interact by double-well potentials allowing for phason flips.\nThe difference between the structure factors of the dynamic and the harmonic\nFibonacci chain lies in the temperature dependence of the phonon line width.

    "abstract": "  We consider the problem of estimating the probability of an observed string\ndrawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The key feature of our study is that\nthe length of the observed string is assumed to be of the same order as the\nsize of the underlying alphabet. In this setting, many letters are unseen and\nthe empirical distribution tends to overestimate the probability of the\nobserved letters. To overcome this problem, the traditional approach to\nprobability estimation is to use the classical Good-Turing estimator. We\nintroduce a natural scaling model and use it to show that the Good-Turing\nsequence probability estimator is not consistent. We then introduce a novel\nsequence probability estimator that is indeed consistent under the natural\nscaling model.\n"

The\nBelinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-type chaotic behaviour is found, for many\nEinstein-matter models (notably those related to the low-energy limit of\nsuperstring theory and M-theory), to be connected with certain\n(infinite-dimensional) hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras.

This suggests\nthat these Kac-Moody algebras are hidden symmetries of the corresponding\nmodels. There even exists some evidence of a hidden equivalence between the\ngeneral solution of the Einstein-three-form system and a null geodesic in the\ninfinite dimensional coset space E_{10}, / K(E_{10},), where K(E_{10},) is the\nmaximal compact subgroup of E_{10},.\n"

G1 has been reported by Gebhardt et al.\nto contain an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of ~2 x 10^4\nsolar masses. Radio emission was detected within an arcsecond of the cluster\ncenter with an 8.4 GHz power of 2 x 10^{15}, W/Hz. The radio/X-ray ratio of G1\nis a few hundred times higher than that expected for a high-mass X-ray binary\nin the cluster center, but is consistent with the expected value for accretion\nonto an IMBH with the reported mass. A pulsar wind nebula is also a possible\ncandidate for the radio and X-ray emission from G1; future high-sensitivity\nVLBI observations might distinguish between this possibility and an IMBH. If\nthe radio source is an IMBH, and similar accretion and outflow processes occur\nfor hypothesized ~ 1000-solar-mass black holes in Milky Way globular clusters,\nthey are within reach of the current VLA and should be detectable easily by the\nExpanded VLA when it comes on line in 2010.\n"

The protocol works with such scarce\nlocal resources by never post-selecting on the measurement outcomes of\npurification rounds.

The oracle property is often a\nconsequence of sparsity of an estimator. We show that any estimator satisfying\na sparsity property has maximal risk that converges to the supremum of the loss\nfunction; in particular, the maximal risk diverges to infinity whenever the\nloss function is unbounded. For ease of presentation the result is set in the\nframework of a linear regression model, but generalizes far beyond that\nsetting. In a Monte Carlo study we also assess the extent of the problem in\nfinite samples for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator\nintroduced in Fan and Li (2001). We find that this estimator can perform rather\npoorly in finite samples and that its worst-case performance relative to\nmaximum likelihood deteriorates with increasing sample size when the estimator\nis tuned to sparsity.\n"

In a first stage we study the\nsemi-infinite system consisting of an isotropic fluid in contact with a single\nhard line. We have found complete wetting by the columnar phase at the\nwall-isotropic fluid interface. When the fluid is confined between two hard\nwalls, capillary columnar ordering occurs via a first-order phase transition.\nFor higher chemical potentials the system exhibits layering transitions even\nfor very narrow slits (near the one-dimensional limit). The theoretical model\nused was a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-Measure\nFunctional applied to a fluid of hard rectangles in the restricted-orientation\napproximation (Zwanzig model). The results presented here can be checked\nexperimentally in two-dimensional granular media made of rods, where vertical\nmotions induced by an external source and excluded volume interactions between\nthe grains allow the system to explore those stationary states which\nentropically maximize packing configurations. We claim that some of the surface\nphenomena found here can be present in two-dimensional granular-media fluids.\n"

At\ntemperatures T < Tc this dangerously irrelevant perturbation is relevant only\nabove a length scale Lambda, which diverges as a power of the correlation\nlength; Lambda ~ xi^a_q. Below Lambda the order parameter is U(1) symmetric.

Here we\nreport the behaviour of seven different members among a family of such\nmaterials, that consists of mesomorphic oxadiazole compounds. In two of these\ncompounds, the optical microscope investigation shows very interesting\nbehaviours. In their smectic phases, fan-shaped and toric textures, sometimes\nwith periodic instability, are observed. Moreover, the nematic phase displays a\ntexture transition. Texture transitions have been previously observed only\ninside the nematic phase of some compounds belonging to the families of the\noxybenzoic and cyclohexane acids. In these two oxadiazole compounds we can\nobserve what we define as a \"toric nematic phase\", heating the samples from the\nsmectic phase. The toric nematic texture disappears as the sample is further\nheated, changing into a smooth texture.\n"

If the Casimir energy densities near one boundary result in a\ncertain constant of integration taking a value greater than around 10^5 in\nunits of the d = 11 gravitational length, a form of thick pipe geometry is\nfound that realizes TeV-scale gravity by the ADD mechanism, with that boundary\nbecoming the inner surface of the thick pipe, where we live. Three alternative\nways in which the outer surface of the thick pipe might be stabilized\nconsistent with the observed value of the effective d = 4 cosmological constant\nare considered. In the first alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in\nthe classical region and the constant of integration is fixed at around 10^{13},\nin units of the d = 11 gravitational length for consistency with the observed\ncosmological constant. In the second alternative, the four observed dimensions\nhave reduced in size down to the d = 11 gravitational length at the outer\nsurface, and there are Casimir effects near the outer surface. In the third\nalternative, the outer surface is stabilized in the classical region by extra\nfluxes of the three-form gauge field, whose four-form field strength wraps\nthree-cycles of the compact six-manifold times the radial dimension of the\nthick pipe. Some problems related to fitting the strong/electroweak Standard\nModel are considered.\n"

Based\non the 8.5 km/s FWHM of the S(2) line, assuming the emission comes from the\ncircumstellar disk, and with an inclination estimate of the AB Aur system taken\nfrom the literature, we place the location for the emission near 18 AU.\nComparison of our derived temperature to a disk structure model suggests that\nUV and X-ray heating are important in heating the disk atmosphere.\n"

    "abstract": "  The LHC will have unprecedented sensitivity to flavor-changing neutral\ncurrent (FCNC) top quark decays, whose observation would be a clear sign of\nphysics beyond the standard model. Although many details of top flavor\nviolation are model dependent, the standard model gauge symmetries relate top\nFCNCs to other processes, which are strongly constrained by existing data. We\nstudy these constraints in a model independent way, using a low energy\neffective theory from which the new physics is integrated out. We consider the\nmost important operators which contribute to top FCNCs and analyze the current\nconstraints on them. We find that the data rule out top FCNCs at a level\nobservable at the LHC due to most of the operators comprising left-handed first\nor second generation quark fields, while there remains a substantial window for\ntop decays mediated by operators with right-handed charm or up quarks. If FCNC\ntop decays are observed at the LHC, such an analysis may help decipher the\nunderlying physics.\n"

Mid- and far-infrared morphology, spectral energy distributions, and\nintegrated colors are used to derive the dust mass, dust-to-gas mass ratio,\ntotal infrared luminosity, and star formation rate (SFR). The 8 micron images\nindicate that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are present in the\ncentral regions of all three metal-poor LSB galaxies. The diffuse optical disks\nof Malin 1 and UGC 9024 remain undetected at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.\nThe dustiest of the three LSB galaxies, UGC 6614, has infrared morphology that\nvaries significantly with wavelength. The 8 and 24 micron emission is\nco-spatial with H\\alpha emission previously observed in the outer ring of UGC\n6614. The estimated dust-to-gas ratios, from less than 10^{-3}, to 10^{-2},,\nsupport previous indications that the LSB galaxies are relatively dust poor\ncompared to the HSB galaxies. The total infrared luminosities are approximately\n1/3 to 1/2 the blue band luminosities, suggesting that old stellar populations\nare the primary source of dust heating in these LSB objects. The SFR estimated\nfrom the infrared data ranges ~0.01-0.88 M_sun yr^{-1},, consistent with results\nfrom optical studies.\n"

Using this definition,\nwe prove the monotone pattern is easier to avoid than almost any other pattern\nof the same length.\n  We also show that with this definition, almost all patterns of length $k$ are\navoided by the same number of permutations of length $n$. The corresponding\nstatements are not known to be true for more relaxed definitions of pattern\ncontainment. This is the first time we know of that expectations are used to\ncompare numbers of permutations avoiding certain patterns.\n"

    "abstract": "  Although taste violations significantly affect the results of staggered\ncalculations of pseudoscalar and heavy-light mesonic quantities, those entering\nstaggered calculations of baryonic quantities have not been quantified. Here I\ndevelop staggered chiral perturbation theory in the light-quark baryon sector\nby mapping the Symanzik action into heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory.\nFor 2+1 dynamical quark flavors, the masses of flavor-symmetric nucleons are\ncalculated to third order in partially quenched and fully dynamical staggered\nchiral perturbation theory. To this order the expansion includes the leading\nchiral logarithms, which come from loops with virtual decuplet-like states, as\nwell as terms the order of the cubed pion mass, which come from loops with\nvirtual octet-like states. Taste violations enter through the meson propagators\nin loops and tree-level terms the order of the squared lattice spacing. The\npattern of taste symmetry breaking and the resulting degeneracies and mixings\nare discussed in detail. The resulting chiral forms are appropriate to lattice\nresults obtained with operators already in use and could be used to study the\nrestoration of taste symmetry in the continuum limit. I assume that the fourth\nroot of the fermion determinant can be incorporated in staggered chiral\nperturbation theory using the replica method.\n"

Here we report the direct imaging of magnetic\nfocusing of electron waves, specifically in a two-dimensional electron gas\n(2DEG). We see the semicircular trajectories of electrons as they bounce along\na boundary in the 2DEG, as well as fringes showing the coherent nature of the\nelectron waves. Imaging flow in open systems is made possible by a cooled\nscanning probe microscope. Remarkable agreement between experiment and theory\ndemonstrates our ability to see these trajectories and to use this system as an\ninterferometer. We image branched electron flow as well as the interference of\nelectron waves. This technique can visualize the motion of electron waves\nbetween two points in an open system, providing a straightforward way to study\nsystems that may be useful for quantum information processing and spintronics.\n"

We confirm our previous\nresults obtained from the study of Ap and Bp stars with accurate measurements\nof the mean magnetic field modulus and mean quadratic magnetic fields that\nmagnetic stars of mass M < 3 M_sun are concentrated towards the centre of the\nmain-sequence band. In contrast, stars with masses M > 3 M_sun seem to be\nconcentrated closer to the ZAMS. The study of a few known members of nearby\nopen clusters with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes confirms these conclusions.\nStronger magnetic fields tend to be found in hotter, younger and more massive\nstars, as well as in stars with shorter rotation periods. No evidence is found\nfor any loss of angular momentum during the main-sequence life. The magnetic\nflux remains constant over the stellar life time on the main sequence. An\nexcess of stars with large obliquities beta is detected in both higher and\nlower mass stars. The obliquity angle distribution as inferred from the\ndistribution of r-values appears random at the time magnetic stars become\nobservable on the H-R diagram. After quite a short time spent on the main\nsequence, the obliquity angle beta tends to reach values close to either 90 deg\nor 0 deg for M < 3 M_sun. The evolution of the obliquity angle beta seems to be\nsomewhat different for low and high mass stars. While we find a strong hint for\nan increase of beta with the elapsed time on the main sequence for stars with M\n> 3 M_sun, no similar trend is found for stars with M < 3 M_sun. However, the\npredominance of high values of beta at advanced ages in these stars is notable.\n"

It remains a conjecture\nthat these relations generate the kernel. My results extend those of\nq-alg/9712003, MR1659228, math.QA/0310143 and math.GT/0506403.\n  The argument is essentially by constructing a diagrammatic version of the\nforgetful functor coming from the inclusion of U_q(sl_{n-1},) in U_q(sl_n},. We\nknow this functor is faithful, so a diagram is in the kernel for n exactly if\nits image under the diagrammatic forgetful functor is in the kernel for n-1.\nThis allows us to perform inductive calculations, both establishing families of\nelements of the kernel, and finding obstructions.\n"

Scattered\nlight is detected up to 14'' from the star. The observations are consistent\nwith the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination as\nthe inner disk. The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and they\ntrail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also\nseen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more\nneutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models\nthat assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the major\ndisk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \\Delta\n(F435W-F606W) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \\Delta (F435W-F814W)~0.5--1 mags. To explain\nthese colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and\nlarge minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by\nitself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived\nfor Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for\ntheir colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the\ngeometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically\nthick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected. The observed\nspiral arms are then structures on this envelope. The colors indicate that the\nextended nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocessed\ndisk material.\n"

    "abstract": "  We propose a model of a heterogeneous glass forming liquid and compute the\nlow-temperature behavior of a tagged molecule moving within it. This model\nexhibits stretched-exponential decay of the wavenumber-dependent, self\nintermediate scattering function in the limit of long times. At temperatures\nclose to the glass transition, where the heterogeneities are much larger in\nextent than the molecular spacing, the time dependence of the scattering\nfunction crosses over from stretched-exponential decay with an index $b=1/2$ at\nlarge wave numbers to normal, diffusive behavior with $b = 1$ at small\nwavenumbers. There is a clear separation between early-stage, cage-breaking\n$\\beta$ relaxation and late-stage $\\alpha$ relaxation. The spatial\nrepresentation of the scattering function exhibits an anomalously broad\nexponential (non-Gaussian) tail for sufficiently large values of the molecular\ndisplacement at all finite times.\n"

    "abstract": "  Abelian topologically massive gauge theories (TMGT) provide a topological\nmechanism to generate mass for a bosonic p-tensor field in any spacetime\ndimension. These theories include the 2+1 dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons and\n3+1 dimensional Cremmer-Scherk actions as particular cases. Within the\nHamiltonian formulation, the embedded topological field theory (TFT) sector\nrelated to the topological mass term is not manifest in the original phase\nspace. However through an appropriate canonical transformation, a gauge\ninvariant factorisation of phase space into two orthogonal sectors is feasible.\nThe first of these sectors includes canonically conjugate gauge invariant\nvariables with free massive excitations. The second sector, which decouples\nfrom the total Hamiltonian, is equivalent to the phase space description of the\nassociated non dynamical pure TFT. Within canonical quantisation, a likewise\nfactorisation of quantum states thus arises for the full spectrum of TMGT in\nany dimension. This new factorisation scheme also enables a definition of the\nusual projection from TMGT onto topological quantum field theories in a most\nnatural and transparent way. None of these results rely on any gauge fixing\nprocedure whatsoever.\n"

The temperature range of the measurements extends from room\ntemperature down to $\\sim$ 10 K. Three samples, #1, #2, and #3 were\nmanufactured from blocks of SiC produced in different lots. The thermal\nexpansion of the samples was measured with a cryogenic dilatometer, consisting\nof a laser interferometer, a cryostat, and a mechanical cooler. The typical\nthermal expansion curve is presented using the 8th order polynomial of the\ntemperature. For the three samples, the coefficients of thermal expansion\n(CTE), $\\bar{\\alpha},_{#1},$, $\\bar{\\alpha},_{#2},$, and $\\bar{\\alpha},_{#3},$ were\nderived for temperatures between 293 K and 10 K. The average and the dispersion\n(1 $\\sigma$ rms) of these three CTEs are 0.816 and 0.002 ($\\times 10^{-6},$/K),\nrespectively. No significant difference was detected in the CTE of the three\nsamples from the different lots. Neither inhomogeneity nor anisotropy of the\nCTE was observed. Based on the obtained CTE dispersion, we performed an\nfinite-element-method (FEM) analysis of the thermal deformation of a 3.5 m\ndiameter cryogenic mirror made of six SiC-100 segments. It was shown that the\npresent CTE measurement has a sufficient accuracy well enough for the design of\nthe 3.5 m cryogenic infrared telescope mission, the Space Infrared telescope\nfor Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA).\n"

The peak line\nemissivities of the photons in the post-shock flow are taken into consideration\nand frequency shifts due to Doppler effects are also included.

The\nresulting line profiles are most sensitive to the inclination angle. We have\nalso explored the effects of modifying the accretion column width and using a\nrealistic emissivity profile. We find that these do not have a significant\noverall effect on the resulting line profiles. A comparison of our simulated\nline spectra with high resolution Chandra/HETGS observations of the mCV GK Per\nindicates that a wing feature redward of the 6.4 keV line may result from\nCompton recoil near the base of the accretion column.\n"

Originally the electron was studied in a non\nrelativistic context and this opened up the interesting possibility that lead\nto the conclusion that the mass of the electron could be thought of entirely in\nelectromagnetic terms without introducing inertial considerations. However the\napplication of Special Relativity lead to several problems, both for an\nextended electron and the point electron. These inconsistencies have, contrary\nto popular belief not been resolved satisfactorily today, even within the\ncontext of Quantum Theory. Nevertheless these and subsequent studies bring out\nthe interesting result that Special Relativity breaks down within the Compton\nscale or when the Compton scale is not neglected.

In turn we use the results to analyze the evolution of structure and\ncomposition of these 1-2 Myr-old disks around Solar- and later-type young\nstars, and test the standard models of dust processing which result in the\nconversion of originally amorphous dust into minerals. We find strong evidence\nof evolution of the dust crystalline mass fraction in parallel with that of the\nstructure of the disks, in the sense that increasing crystalline mass fraction\nis strongly linked to dust settling to the disk midplane. We also confirm that\nthe crystalline silicates are confined to small radii, r < 10 AU. However, we\nsee no significant correlation of crystalline mass fraction with stellar mass\nor luminosity, stellar accretion rate, disk mass, or disk/star mass ratio, as\nwould be expected in the standard models of dust processing based upon\nphoto-evaporation and condensation close to the central star,\naccretion-heating-driven annealing at r < 1 AU, or spiral-shock heating at r <\n10 AU, with or without effective radial mixing mechanisms. Either another\ngrain-crystallizing mechanism dominates over these, or another process must be\nat work within the disks to erase the correlations they produce. We propose one\nof each sort that seem to be worth further investigation, namely X-ray heating\nand annealing of dust grains, and modulation of disk structure by\ngiant-planetary formation and migration.\n"

    "abstract": "  (Abridged) We use 3D SPH calculations with higher resolution, as well as with\nmore realistic viscosity and sound-speed prescriptions than previous work to\nexamine the eccentric instability which underlies the superhump phenomenon in\nsemi-detached binaries. We illustrate the importance of the two-armed spiral\nmode in the generation of superhumps. Differential motions in the fluid disc\ncause converging flows which lead to strong spiral shocks once each superhump\ncycle. The dissipation associated with these shocks powers the superhump. We\ncompare 2D and 3D results, and conclude that 3D simulations are necessary to\nfaithfully simulate the disc dynamics. We ran our simulations for unprecedented\ndurations, so that an eccentric equilibrium is established except at high mass\nratios where the growth rate of the instability is very low. Our improved\nsimulations give a closer match to the observed relationship between superhump\nperiod excess and binary mass ratio than previous numerical work. The observed\nblack hole X-ray transient superhumpers appear to have systematically lower\ndisc precession rates than the cataclysmic variables. This could be due to\nhigher disc temperatures and thicknesses. The modulation in total viscous\ndissipation on the superhump period is overwhelmingly from the region of the\ndisc within the 3:1 resonance radius. As the eccentric instability develops,\nthe viscous torques are enhanced, and the disc consequently adjusts to a new\nequilibrium state, as suggested in the thermal-tidal instability model. We\nquantify this enhancement in the viscosity, which is ~10 per cent for q=0.08.\nWe characterise the eccentricity distributions in our accretion discs, and show\nthat the entire body of the disc partakes in the eccentricity.\n"

Adopting an improved model for gas\nthermalization and CR acceleration efficiencies based on nonlinear diffusive\nshock acceleration calculations, we then estimate the gas thermal energy and\nthe CR energy dissipated at shocks through the history of the universe. Since\nshocks can serve as sites for generation of vorticity, we also examine the\nvorticity that should have been generated mostly at curved shocks in\ncosmological simulations. We find that the dynamics and energetics of shocks\nare governed primarily by the gravity of matter, so other non-gravitational\nprocesses do not affect significantly the global energy dissipation and\nvorticity generation at cosmological shocks.

The spectra reveal for the\nfirst time the presence of CO2 ice on the surfaces of Umbriel and Titania, by\nmeans of 3 narrow absorption bands near 2 microns. Several additional, weaker\nCO2 ice absorptions have also been detected. No CO2 absorption is seen in\nOberon spectra, and the strengths of the CO2 ice bands decline with\nplanetocentric distance from Ariel through Titania. We use the CO2 absorptions\nto map the longitudinal distribution of CO2 ice on Ariel, Umbriel, and Titania,\nshowing that it is most abundant on their trailing hemispheres. We also examine\nH2O ice absorptions in the spectra, finding deeper H2O bands on the leading\nhemispheres of Ariel, Umbriel, and Titania, but the opposite pattern on Oberon.\nPotential mechanisms to produce the observed longitudinal and planetocentric\ndistributions of the two ices are considered.\n"

It is\nshown that the superconductivity is of conventional s-wave type and lies in the\nextremely strong-coupling regime. Specific heat and resistivity measurements\nreveal that there are characteristic low-energy phonons that give rise to\nunusual scattering of carriers due to strong electron-phonon interactions. The\nentity of the low-energy phonons is ascribed to the heavy rattling of the K ion\nconfined in an oversized cage made of OsO6 octahedra.

    "abstract": "  A study of the $p d \\to p d \\eta$ reaction in the energy range where the\nrecent data from Uppsala are available, is done in the two-step model of $\\eta$\nproduction including the final state interaction. The $\\eta -d$ final state\ninteraction is incorporated through the solution of the Lippmann Schwinger\nequation using an elastic scattering matrix element, $T_{\\eta d \\to \\eta d},$,\nwhich is required to be half off-shell. It is written in a factorized form,\nwith an off-shell form factor multiplying an on-shell part given by an\neffective range expansion up to the fourth power in momentum. The parameters of\nthis expansion have been taken from an existing recent relativistic Faddeev\nequation solution for the $\\eta NN$ system corresponding to different $\\eta-N$\nscattering amplitudes. Calculations have also been done using few body\nequations within a finite rank approximation (FRA) to generate $T_{\\eta d \\to\n\\eta d},$. The $p-d$ final state interaction is included in the spirit of the\nWatson-Migdal prescription by multiplying the matrix element by the inverse of\nthe Jost function. The $\\eta-d$ interaction is found to be dominant in the\nregion of small invariant $\\eta -d$ mass, $M_{\\eta d},$. The $p-d$ interaction\nenhances the cross section in the whole region of $M_{\\eta d},$, but is larger\nfor large $M_{\\eta d},$. We find nearly isotropic angular distributions of the\nproton and the deuteron in the final state. All the above observations are in\nagreement with data. The production mechanism for the entire range of the\nexisting data on the $p d \\to p d \\eta$ reaction seems to be dominated by the\ntwo-step model of $\\eta$ production.\n"

In this\nmodel, the radial distances of the photons corresponding to different phases\ncan be determined in the numerical calculation. Also the local electrodynamics,\nsuch as the accelerating electric field, the curvature radius of the magnetic\nfield line and the soft photon energy, are sensitive to the radial distances to\nthe neutron star.

It tends to infinity at long\nwavelength, which yields a Bose glass state that is robust to the addition of\nweak point-pinning centers, and which implies a restoring force per vortex line\nfor rigid translations about mechanical equilibrium that is independent of\nmagnetic field. It also indicates that the Bose glass state breaks into pieces\nalong the direction of the correlated pinning centers if the latter have finite\nlength. The critical current is predicted to crossover from two dimensional to\nthree dimensional behavior as a function of sample thickness along the\ncorrelated pinning centers in such case. That crossover notably can occur at a\nfilm thickness that is much larger than that expected from point pins of\ncomparable strength. The above is compared to the dependence on thickness shown\nby the critical current in certain films of high-temperature superconductors\ncurrently being developed for wire technology.\n"

    "abstract": "  An interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations (phonons) results in\ntwo fundamental quantum phenomena in solids: in three dimensions it can turn a\nmetal into a superconductor whereas in one dimension it can turn a metal into\nan insulator. In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density\nwaves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical\ntransition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed\neven above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the\nresistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than\nin the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable\nnesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by\nthe same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of\nalternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the\nmost fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest\ndevelopments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the\nmost studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is\ndriven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap.\nOur findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed,\nexperimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoretical\napproaches. The magnitude, character and anisotropy of the 2D-CDW pseudogap are\nintriguingly similar to those seen in superconducting cuprates.\n"

    "title": "Optimal flexibility for conformational transitions in macromolecules",
    "abstract": "  Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the\nreorientation of lever-like structures. Using a simple theoretical model, we\nshow that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is\nbendable, e.g. at a localized \"hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest\nwith an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the\ntransition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of \"cargo'' attached to\nthe lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this\neffect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier\ncrossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices.\n"

More generally if a finite dimensional Hopf $*$-algebra $A$ acts on\n$M$ and the action is saturated, the same is true with $Index (E)=\\dim(A)$. In\nthis paper we prove that the converse is true.

    "abstract": "  Density-functional theory has been applied to investigate systematics of\nsodium clusters Na_n in the size range of n= 39-55. A clear evolutionary trend\nin the growth of their ground-state geometries emerges. The clusters at the\nbeginning of the series (n=39-43) are symmetric and have partial icosahedral\n(two-shell) structure. The growth then goes through a series of disordered\nclusters (n=44-52) where the icosahedral core is lost. However, for n>52 a\nthree shell icosahedral structure emerges. This change in the nature of the\ngeometry is abrupt. In addition, density-functional molecular dynamics has been\nused to calculate the specific heat curves for the representative sizes n= 43,\n45, 48 and 52. These results along with already available thermodynamic\ncalculations for n= 40, 50, and 55 enable us to carry out a detailed comparison\nof the heat capacity curves with their respective geometries for the entire\nseries. Our results clearly bring out strong correlation between the evolution\nof the geometries and the nature of the shape of the heat capacities. The\nresults also firmly establish the size-sensitive nature of the heat capacities\nin sodium clusters.\n"

In this\ncontribution, we examine what happens for a closed system if one considers a\nquantum Zeno type of question, namely: \"what is the probability of a system,\nremaining always in a particular subspace\". This has implications to the\narrival time problem that is also discussed. We employ the decoherent histories\napproach to quantum theory, as this is the better developed formulation of\nclosed system quantum mechanics, and in particular, dealing with questions that\ninvolve time in a non-trivial way. We get a very restrictive decoherence\ncondition, that implies that even if we do introduce an environment, there will\nbe very few cases that we can assign probabilities to these histories, but in\nthose cases, the quantum Zeno effect is still present.\n"

Thereby we concentrate on easy plane\nsystems, i.e. systems for which the anisotropy favors a magnetization parallel\nto the film plane. We discuss these systems in perpendicular external field,\ni.e. B parallel to the film normal. GFT results are in good agreement with QMC\nfor high enough fields and temperatures. Below a critical field or a critical\ntemperature no collinear stable magnetization exists in GFT. On the other hand\nQMC gives finite magnetization even below those critical values. This indicates\nthat there occurs a transition from non-collinear to collinear configurations\nwith increasing field or temperature. For slightly tilted external fields a\nrotation of magnetization from out-of-plane to in-plane orientation is found\nwith decreasing temperature.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present Spitzer IRS low resolution, mid-IR spectra of a sample of 25 high\nluminosity QSOs at 2<z<3.5. When combined with archival IRS observations of\nlocal, low luminosity type-I AGNs, the sample spans five orders of magnitude in\nluminosity. We find that the continuum dust thermal emission at\nlambda(rest)=6.7um is correlated with the optical luminosity, following the\nnon-linear relation L(6.7um) propto L(5100A)^0.82. We also find an anti\ncorrelation between the ratio L(6.7um)/L(5100A) and the [OIII]5007A line\nluminosity. These effects are interpreted as a decreasing covering factor of\nthe circumnuclear dust as a function of luminosity. Such a result is in\nagreement with the decreasing fraction of absorbed AGNs as a function of\nluminosity recently found in various surveys. We clearly detect the silicate\nemission feature in the average spectrum, but also in four individual objects.\nThese are the Silicate emission in the most luminous objects obtained so far.\nWhen combined with the silicate emission observed in local, low luminosity\ntype-I AGNs, we find that the silicate emission strength is correlated with\nluminosity.\n  The silicate strength of all type-I AGNs also follows a positive correlation\nwith the black hole mass and with the accretion rate. The Polycyclic Aromatic\nHydrocarbon (PAH) emission features, expected from starburst activity, are not\ndetected in the average spectrum of luminous, high-z QSOs. The upper limit\ninferred from the average spectrum points to a ratio between PAH luminosity and\nQSO optical luminosity significantly lower than observed in lower luminosity\nAGNs, implying that the correlation between star formation rate and AGN power\nsaturates at high luminosities.\n"

We use the combined GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy\nformation model and GRASIL spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy SEDs\nincluding the reprocessing of radiation by dust. The model, which is the same\nas that in Baugh et al (2005), assumes two different IMFs: a normal solar\nneighbourhood IMF for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavy\nIMF in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. We have shown previously that\nthe top-heavy IMF seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faint\nsub-mm galaxies. We compare the model with observational data from the SPITZER\nSpace Telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen before\nSPITZER data became available. We find that the model matches the observed\nevolution in the IR remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probed\nby SPITZER. In particular, the SPITZER data show that there is strong evolution\nin the mid-IR galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, and\nthis is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.\nOn the other hand, a model with a normal IMF in starbursts predicts far too\nlittle evolution in the mid-IR luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.\n"

    "title": "The effect of the solar corona on the attenuation of small-amplitude\n  prominence oscillations. I. Longitudinal magnetic field",
    "abstract": "  Context. One of the typical features shown by observations of solar\nprominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of\nthe damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding\noscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is\nstill not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick\nradiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their\nrole on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The\ndispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived\nconsidering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an\nunbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel\nto the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the\ndispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is\nobtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect\nof conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode\nand depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the\ninternal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the\nfast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and\nthe external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external\ncorona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow\nmodes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions.\nNon-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic\nmodes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those\nobserved.\n"

We introduce a computational asymmetry function that measures\nthe amount of one-wayness of permutations. We also introduce the word-length\nasymmetry function for groups, which is an algebraic analogue of computational\nasymmetry. We relate boolean circuits to words in a Thompson monoid, over a\nfixed generating set, in such a way that circuit size is equal to word-length.\nMoreover, boolean circuits have a representation in terms of elements of a\nThompson group, in such a way that circuit size is polynomially equivalent to\nword-length. We show that circuits built with gates that are not constrained to\nhave fixed-length inputs and outputs, are at most quadratically more compact\nthan circuits built from traditional gates (with fixed-length inputs and\noutputs). Finally, we show that the computational asymmetry function is closely\nrelated to certain distortion functions: The computational asymmetry function\nis polynomially equivalent to the distortion of the path length in Schreier\ngraphs of certain Thompson groups, compared to the path length in Cayley graphs\nof certain Thompson monoids. We also show that the results of Razborov and\nothers on monotone circuit complexity lead to exponential lower bounds on\ncertain distortions.\n"

    "abstract": "  We show that the surface gravity of a transiting extrasolar planet can be\ncalculated from only the spectroscopic orbit of its parent star and the\nanalysis of its transit light curve. This does not require additional\nconstraints, such as are often inferred from theoretical stellar models or\nmodel atmospheres. The planet's surface gravity can therefore be measured\nprecisely and from only directly observable quantities. We outline the method\nand apply it to the case of the first known transiting extrasolar planet, HD\n209458b. We find a surface gravity of g_p = 9.28 +/- 0.15 m/s, which is an\norder of magnitude more precise than the best available measurements of its\nmass, radius and density. This confirms that the planet has a much lower\nsurface gravity that that predicted by published theoretical models of gas\ngiant planets. We apply our method to all fourteen known transiting extrasolar\nplanets and find a significant correlation between surface gravity and orbital\nperiod, which is related to the known correlation between mass and period. This\ncorrelation may be the underlying effect as surface gravity is a fundamental\nparameter in the evaporation of planetary atmospheres.\n"

ASIC total energy calculations are mapped onto an\nHeisenberg pair-wise interaction and the exchange constants J are compared to\nthose obtained with other methods. In general the ASIC scheme drastically\nimproves the bandstructure, which for almost all the cases investigated\nresemble closely available photo-emission data. In contrast the results for the\nexchange parameters are less satisfactory. Although ASIC performs reasonably\nwell for systems where the magnetism originates from half-filled bands, it\nsuffers from similar problems than those of LDA for other situations. In\nparticular the exchange constants are still overestimated. This reflects a\nsubtle interplay between exchange and correlation energy, not captured by the\nASIC.\n"

It is based on eight existing catalogs wherein we have\ncross-referenced identifications and endeavored to resolve inconsistencies\nbetween them. Our catalog contains 451 candidates of which 255 are confirmed\nclusters based on HST and high resolution ground-based imaging. The catalog\ncontains precise cluster positions (RA and Dec), magnitudes and colors in the\nUBVRIJHKs filters, metallicities, radial velocities, masses and ages, where\navailable, and galactocentric distances for each cluster. The color\ndistribution of the M33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud with major peaks at (B-V)o~0.15, and (B-V)o~0.65. The\nintrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5}, to\n10^{10.3}, years. The age distribution of the star clusters supports the notion\nof rapid cluster disruption with a slope of alpha=-1.09 +/- 0.07 in the\ndN_{cluster},/dt ~ t^{alpha}, relation. In addition, comparison to theoretical\nsingle stellar population models suggests the presence of an age-metallicity\nrelation among these clusters with younger clusters being more metal-rich.\nAnalysis of the radial distribution of the clusters yields some evidence that\nyounger clusters (age <~ 1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of\nM33 than older ones. A similar comparison with the radial profile of the M33\nfield stars shows the clusters to be more centrally concentrated at the greater\nthan 99.9% confidence level. Possible reasons for this are presented and\ndiscussed; however, the overwhelming conclusion seems to be that a more\ncomplete and thorough cluster search is needed covering at least 4 square\ndegrees centered on M33.\n"

We have derived\nglobal properties for each cluster, such as their mean recessional velocity,\nvelocity dispersion, and virial radii. Cluster galaxies have been grouped in\ntwo families according to their $u-r$ colours. The total sample consists of\n10865 galaxies. As expected, the highest fraction of galaxies (62%) turned to\nbe early-type (red) ones, being located at smaller distances from the cluster\ncentre and showing lower velocity dispersions than late-type (blue) ones. The\nbrightest cluster galaxies are located in the innermost regions and show the\nsmallest velocity dispersions. Early-type galaxies also show constant velocity\ndispersion profiles inside the virial radius and a mild decline in the\noutermost regions. In contrast, late-type galaxies show always decreasing\nvelocity dispersions profiles. No correlation has been found between the\nfraction of blue galaxies and cluster global properties, such as cluster\nvelocity dispersion and galaxy concentration. In contrast, we found correlation\nbetween the X-ray luminosity and the fraction of blue galaxies. These results\nindicate that early- and late-type galaxies may have had different evolution.\nThus, blue galaxies are located in more anisotropic and radial orbits than\nearly-type ones. Their star formation seems to be independent of the cluster\nglobal properties in low mass clusters, but not for the most massive ones.\nThese observational results suggest that the global environment could be\nimportant for driving the evolution of galaxies in the most massive cluster\n($\\sigma > 800$ km s$^{-1},$). However, the local environment could play a key\nrole in galaxy evolution for low mass clusters.\n"

    "title": "Can One Estimate The Unconditional Distribution of Post-Model-Selection\n  Estimators?",
    "abstract": "  We consider the problem of estimating the unconditional distribution of a\npost-model-selection estimator. The notion of a post-model-selection estimator\nhere refers to the combined procedure resulting from first selecting a model\n(e.g., by a model selection criterion like AIC or by a hypothesis testing\nprocedure) and then estimating the parameters in the selected model (e.g., by\nleast-squares or maximum likelihood), all based on the same data set. We show\nthat it is impossible to estimate the unconditional distribution with\nreasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that no\nestimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally).\nThis follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performance\nof estimators for the distribution; performance is here measured by the\nprobability that the estimation error exceeds a given threshold. These lower\nbounds are shown to approach 1/2 or even 1 in large samples, depending on the\nsituation considered. Similar impossibility results are also obtained for the\ndistribution of linear functions (e.g., predictors) of the post-model-selection\nestimator.\n"

    "abstract": "  Using Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Seyfert 1 and 1.2 data spanning 9 years, we\nstudy correlations between X-ray spectral features. The sample consists of 350\ntime-resolved spectra from 12 Seyfert 1 and 1.2 galaxies. Each spectrum is\nfitted to a model with an intrinsic powerlaw X-ray spectrum produced close to\nthe central black hole that is reprocessed and absorbed by material around the\nblack hole. To test the robustness of our results, we performed Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the spectral sample. We find a complex relationship between the\niron line equivalent width (EW) and the underlying power law index (Gamma). The\ndata reveal a correlation between Gamma and EW which turns over at Gamma <~ 2,\nbut finds a weak anti-correlation for steeper photon indices. We propose that\nthis relationship is driven by dilution of a disk spectrum (which includes the\nnarrow iron line) by a beamed jet component and, hence, could be used as a\ndiagnostic of jet-dominance. In addition, our sample shows a strong correlation\nbetween the reflection fraction (R) and Gamma, but we find that it is likely\nthe result of modeling degeneracies. We also see the X-ray Baldwin effect (an\nanti-correlation between the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and EW) for the sample\nas a whole, but not for the individual galaxies and galaxy types.\n"

In the type II seesaw mechanism, in addition to the\ntype I seesaw contribution, an additional direct mass term for the light\nneutrinos is present. We consider type II seesaw scenarios where this\nadditional contribution arises from the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs\ntriplet, and furthermore an effective model-independent approach. We\ninvestigate bounds on the flavour-specific decay asymmetries, on the mass of\nthe lightest right-handed neutrino and on the reheat temperature of the early\nuniverse, and compare them to the corresponding bounds in the type I seesaw\nframework. We show that while flavour-dependent thermal type II leptogenesis\nbecomes more efficient for larger mass scale of the light neutrinos, and the\nbounds become relaxed, the type I seesaw scenario for leptogenesis becomes more\nconstrained. We also argue that in general, flavour-dependent effects cannot be\nignored when dealing with leptogenesis in type II seesaw models.\n"

The actual behavior of the bond entropy depends on the particular\ncharacteristics of the transition under study. For the Kosterlitz-Thouless type\nphase transition from a Luttinger liquid phase to a charge density wave state\nthe bond entropy has a local maximum while in the transition from the Luttinger\nliquid to the phase separated state the derivative of the bond entropy has a\ndivergence due to the cancelation of the third eigenvalue of the two-site\nreduced density matrix.\n"

We estimate the stellar mass\nfrom broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy star\nformation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to a\ncontinuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)\nstellar masses. At low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population of\nlow-mass galaxies (<10^9 Msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (M_I-M_K=0.3).\nIn general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and more\nsignificantly above this redshift. Conversely, a massive tail is present up to\nz=2.5 and have extremely red colours (M_I-M_K=0.7-0.8). We find a decline with\nredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% for\nM>10^8 Msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution\n(`mass-downsizing'). In particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible\n(<30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (>6x10^10 Msun). For less\nmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. A large fraction (>=50%)\nof massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gas\ninto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of their\nassembly history below z=1. This fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. Low-mass\nsystems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor up\nto 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assembly\nalso at z<1.\n"

However, very few X-ray polarization\nmeasurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilst\nseveral objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.\nIn this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarization\nfrom cosmic sources is possible using the Compton technique, in particular with\nthe proposed PoGOLite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 keV range. We use\nGeant4 simulations of a PoGOLite model and input photon spectra based on Cygnus\nX-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mCrab). Effective observing times of 6\nand 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long duration\nflight respectively. Both smooth and sharp energy variations of the\npolarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signals\nusing chi-square statistics. We can reject constant polarization, with energy,\nfor the Cygnus X-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component is\nassumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made for\nweaker polarization. For the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can be\nrejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%\npolarization, and similarly for a negative step distribution from 30% to 0%\npolarization.\n"

    "abstract": "  We show that holographic models of QCD predict the presence of a Chern-Simons\ncoupling between vector and axial-vector mesons at finite baryon density. In\nthe AdS/CFT dictionary, the coefficient of this coupling is proportional to the\nbaryon number density, and is fixed uniquely in the five-dimensional\nholographic dual by anomalies in the flavor currents. For the lightest mesons,\nthe coupling mixes transverse $\\rho$ and $a_1$ polarization states. At\nsufficiently large baryon number densities, it produces an instability, which\ncauses the $\\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons to condense in a state breaking both\nrotational and translational invariance.\n"

    "abstract": "  Swift triggered on a precursor to the main burst of GRB 061121 (z=1.314),\nallowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. Many\nother telescopes, including Konus-Wind, XMM-Newton, ROTSE and the Faulkes\nTelescope North, also observed the burst. The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical\nemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical and\nX-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main\npeak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt\nemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.\nThe Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from\n1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. The\noptical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather\nthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED\nshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour\nmight be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities\nsimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The\nafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.\nAlthough the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are\nconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 is\nthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using a\ncombination of Swift and Konus-Wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of\n2.8x10^53 erg over 1keV - 10MeV in the GRB rest frame. A probable jet break is\ndetected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for the\nbeaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.\n"

Such work was frequently motivated\nby new emerging applications of Burgers model to statistical physics,\ncosmology, and fluid dynamics. Also Burgers turbulence appeared as one of the\nsimplest instances of a nonlinear system out of equilibrium. The study of\nrandom Lagrangian systems, of stochastic partial differential equations and\ntheir invariant measures, the theory of dynamical systems, the applications of\nfield theory to the understanding of dissipative anomalies and of multiscaling\nin hydrodynamic turbulence have benefited significantly from progress in\nBurgers turbulence. The aim of this review is to give a unified view of\nselected work stemming from these rather diverse disciplines.\n"

    "abstract": "  The focusing performance of X-ray optics (conveniently expressed in terms of\nHEW, Half Energy Width) strongly depend on both mirrors deformations and photon\nscattering caused by the microroughness of reflecting surfaces. In particular,\nthe contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually\nan increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard\nX-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS),\nthe X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also\nin the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]\n  Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering\ncontribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in\nterms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established\ntheory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the\nbasis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical\ntranslation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice\nversa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This\nPSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the\nH(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.\n  We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to\ncompute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the\nPSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverse\nproblem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirror\nsurface PSD from a measured function H(E). The same formalism allows\nestablishing the maximum allowed PSD of the mirror in order to fulfill a given\nH(E) requirement. [...]\n"

The channels\nincluded in the calculations are $\\pi N$, $\\eta N$ and $\\pi\\pi N$ which has\n$\\pi\\Delta$, $\\rho N$, and $\\sigma N$ resonant components. The non-resonant\nmeson-baryon interactions of the model are derived from a set of Lagrangians by\nusing a unitary transformation method. One or two bare excited nucleon states\nin each of $S$, $P$, $D$, and $F$ partial waves are included to generate the\nresonant amplitudes in the fits. The parameters of the model are first\ndetermined by fitting as much as possible the empirical $\\pi N$ elastic\nscattering amplitudes of SAID up to 2 GeV. We then refine and confirm the\nresulting parameters by directly comparing the predicted differential cross\nsection and target polarization asymmetry with the original data of the elastic\n$\\pi^{\\pm}, p \\to \\pi^{\\pm}, p$ and charge-exchange $\\pi^- p \\to \\pi^0 n$\nprocesses. The predicted total cross sections of $\\pi N$ reactions and $\\pi\nN\\to \\eta N$ reactions are also in good agreement with the data. Applications\nof the constructed model in analyzing the electromagnetic meson production data\nas well as the future developments are discussed.\n"

Based on its morphology, it has been suggested that the flattened\nmolecular gas distribution around the YSO HW2 may be a 350-AU-radius massive\nprotostellar disk. Goal of our work is to ascertain the nature of this\nstructure. We have employed the Plateau de Bure Interferometer to acquire\n(sub-)arcsecond-resolution imaging of high-density and shock tracers, such as\nmethyl cyanide (CH3CN) and silicon monoxide (SiO), towards the HW2 position. On\nthe 1-arcsecond (about 725 AU) scale, the flattened distribution of molecular\ngas around HW2 appears to be due to the projected superposition, on the plane\nof the sky, of at least three protostellar objects, of which at least one is\npowering a molecular outflow at a small angle with respect to the line of\nsight. The presence of a protostellar disk around HW2 is not ruled out, but\nsuch structure is likely to be detected on a smaller spatial scale, or using\ndifferent molecular tracers.\n"

    "title": "Nanodevices and Maxwell's Demon",
    "abstract": "  In the last twenty years there has been significant progress in our\nunderstanding of quantum transport far from equilibrium and a conceptual\nframework has emerged through a combination of the Landauer approach with the\nnon-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method, which is now being widely used in\nthe analysis and design of nanoscale devices. It provides a unified description\nfor all kinds of devices from molecular conductors to carbon nanotubes to\nsilicon transistors covering different transport regimes from the ballistic to\nthe diffusive limit. In this talk I use a simple version of this model to\nanalyze a specially designed device that could be called an electronic\nMaxwell's demon, one that lets electrons go preferentially in one direction\nover another. My objective is to illustrate the fundamental role of contacts\nand demons in transport and energy conversion. The discussion is kept at an\nacademic level steering clear of real world details, but the illustrative\ndevices we use are very much within the capabilities of present-day technology.\nFor example, recent experiments on thermoelectric effects in molecular\nconductors agree well with the predictions from our model. The Maxwell's demon\ndevice itself is very similar to the pentalayer spin-torque device which has\nbeen studied by a number of groups though we are not aware of any discussion of\nthe possibility of using the device as a nanoscale heat engine or as a\nrefrigerator as proposed here. However, my objective is not to evaluate\npossible practical applications. Rather it is to introduce a simple transparent\nmodel showing how out-of-equibrium demons suitably incorporated into\nnanodevices can achieve energy conversion.\n"

    "abstract": "  We study the mixing time of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling from\nthe uniform distribution on proper 7-colourings of a finite rectangular\nsub-grid of the infinite square lattice, the grid. A systematic scan Markov\nchain cycles through finite-size subsets of vertices in a deterministic order\nand updates the colours assigned to the vertices of each subset. The systematic\nscan Markov chain that we present cycles through subsets consisting of 2x2\nsub-grids and updates the colours assigned to the vertices using a procedure\nknown as heat-bath. We give a computer-assisted proof that this systematic scan\nMarkov chain mixes in O(log n) scans, where n is the size of the rectangular\nsub-grid. We make use of a heuristic to compute required couplings of\ncolourings of 2x2 sub-grids. This is the first time the mixing time of a\nsystematic scan Markov chain on the grid has been shown to mix for less than 8\ncolours. We also give partial results that underline the challenges of proving\nrapid mixing of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling 6-colourings of the\ngrid by considering 2x3 and 3x3 sub-grids.\n"

    "title": "Thin elastic shells with variable thickness for lithospheric flexure of\n  one-plate planets",
    "abstract": "  Planetary topography can either be modeled as a load supported by the\nlithosphere, or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by\nmantle convection. In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external\nforces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On\none-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an\nimportant role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the\ndeformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the\nassumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity\nand topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the\nlithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing\nthe deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable\nYoung's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except\nfor a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the\ntransverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include\nbottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress\nfunctions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further\nshow that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness\nvaries, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the\ndegree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal\ntangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell\nand are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure\nequations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the\nprediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the\nconstruction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.\n"

    "abstract": "  We describe XMM-Newton observations taken 4.3 days prior to and 1.5 days\nsubsequent to two remarkable events that were detected with Swift on 2006\nSeptember 21 from the candidate magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216: (1) a 20 ms\nburst with an energy of 1e37 erg (15-150 keV), and (2) a rapid spin-down\n(glitch) with a fractionap period change of 1e-4. We find that the luminosity\nof the pulsar increased by a factor of 100 in the interval between\nobservations, from 1e33 to 1e35 erg/s (0.5-8.0 keV), and that its spectrum\nhardened. The pulsed count rate increased by a factor of 10 (0.5-8.0 keV), but\nthe fractional rms amplitude of the pulses decreased from 65 to 11 per cent,\nand their profile changed from being single-peaked to exhibiting three peaks.\nSimilar changes have been observed from other magnetars in response to\noutbursts, such as that of 1E 2259+586 in 2002 June. We suggest that a plastic\ndeformation of the neutron star's crust induced a very slight twist in the\nexternal magnetic field, which in turn generated currents in the magnetosphere\nthat were the direct cause of the X-ray outburst.\n"

    "abstract": "  In the decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model galaxies are assumed to be\nborn as compact objects that have been ejected with large intrinsic redshift\ncomponents, z_(i), out of the nuclei of mature AGN galaxies. As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =\n0.06 is also seen. It is associated in the DIR model with an increase in\nluminosity as the sources mature but, if real, is difficult to interpret in the\ncosmological redshift (CR) model since at this low redshift it is unlikely to\nbe associated with a higher star formation rate or an increase in the material\nused to build galaxies. Whether it might be possible in the CR model to explain\nthese results by selection effects is also examined.\n"

Assuming that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes reflect\naccurately the motion of the binary components, then from our results: K_em =\n107+/-2 km/s; K_abs = 310+/-5 km/s, and using the inclination angle given by\nZhang & Robinson(1987); i = 69.7+/-0.7, the system parameters become: M_WD =\n1.20+/-0.05 M_sun,; M_RD = 0.42+/-0.04 M_sun; and a = 1.55+/- 0.02 R_sun. Based\non the separation of the double emission peaks, we calculate an outer disk\nradius of R_out/a ~0.61, close to the distance of the inner Lagrangian point\nL_1/a~0.63. Therefore we suggest that, at the time of observations, the\naccretion disk was filling the Roche-Lobe of the primary, and that the matter\nleaving the L_1 point was colliding with the disc directly, producing the hot\nspot at this location.\n"

    "abstract": "  We study ground state properties and excitation spectra for hard-core Bosons\non square and triangular lattices, at half filling, using series expansion\nmethods. Nearest-neighbor repulsion between the Bosons leads to the development\nof short-range density order at the antiferromagnetic wavevector, and\nsimultaneously a roton minima in the density excitation spectra. On the\nsquare-lattice, the model maps on to the well studied XXZ model, and the roton\ngap collapses to zero precisely at the Heisenberg symmetry point, leading to\nthe well known spectra for the Heisenberg antiferromagnet. On the\ntriangular-lattice, the collapse of the roton gap signals the onset of the\nsupersolid phase. Our results suggest that the transition from the superfluid\nto the supersolid phase maybe weakly first order. We also find several features\nin the density of states, including two-peaks and a sharp discontinuity, which\nmaybe observable in experimental realization of such systems.\n"

We have\napplied this model to the sample of 8 comets thus far observed with the Chandra\nX-ray observatory and ACIS spectrometer in the 300-1000 eV range. The surveyed\ncomets are C/1999 S4 (LINEAR), C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley), C/2000 WM1\n(LINEAR), 153P/2002 (Ikeya-Zhang), 2P/2003 (Encke), C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), 9P/2005\n(Tempel 1) and 73P/2006-B (Schwassmann-Wachmann 3) and the observations include\na broad variety of comets, solar wind environments and observational\nconditions. The interaction model is based on state selective, velocity\ndependent charge exchange cross sections and is used to explore how cometary\nX-ray emission depend on cometary, observational and solar wind\ncharacteristics. It is further demonstrated that cometary X-ray spectra mainly\nreflect the state of the local solar wind. The current sample of Chandra\nobservations was fit using the constrains of the charge exchange model, and\nrelative solar wind abundances were derived from the X-ray spectra. Our\nanalysis showed that spectral differences can be ascribed to different solar\nwind states, as such identifying comets interacting with (I) fast, cold wind,\n(II), slow, warm wind and (III) disturbed, fast, hot winds associated with\ninterplanetary coronal mass ejections. We furthermore predict the existence of\na fourth spectral class, associated with the cool, fast high latitude wind.\n"

The universal behaviour of the scalar field and its potential is also\ncalculated. We conclude that the phantom scalar field conformally coupled to\ngravity gives a natural dynamical mechanism of concentration of the equation of\nstate coefficient around the magical value $w_{\\text{eff},},=-1$.

    "abstract": "  The early Solar System contained short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe (t1/2\n= 1.5 Myr) whose most likely source was a nearby supernova. Previous models of\nSolar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapse\nof the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis,\nthat the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very\nclose (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.\nWe conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions\nrelated to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close\nsupernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations\ndemonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to\nescape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss\noccur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the\ndisk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These\nlow efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the\nhigh disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk\nbefore stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be\nconsistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On\nthe other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into\ndust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be\ninjected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoritic\nabundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore are\nconsistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1\npc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.\n"

It is known that a geodesic motion sometimes occurs\nin the presence of a scalar potential and for time-dependent solutions this can\nhappen for scaling cosmologies. This note contains a further study of such\nsolutions in the context of pseudo-supersymmetry for multi-field systems whose\nfirst-order equations we derive using a Bogomol'nyi-like method. In particular\nwe show that scaling solutions that are pseudo-BPS must describe geodesic\ncurves.

    "abstract": "  We quantify the effect of supernova Type Ia peculiar velocities on the\nderivation of cosmological parameters. The published distant and local Ia SNe\nused for the Supernova Legacy Survey first-year cosmology report form the\nsample for this study. While previous work has assumed that the local SNe are\nat rest in the CMB frame (the No Flow assumption), we test this assumption by\napplying peculiar velocity corrections to the local SNe using three different\nflow models. The models are based on the IRAS PSCz galaxy redshift survey, have\nvarying beta = Omega_m^0.6/b, and reproduce the Local Group motion in the CMB\nframe. These datasets are then fit for w, Omega_m, and Omega_Lambda using\nflatness or LambdaCDM and a BAO prior. The chi^2 statistic is used to examine\nthe effect of the velocity corrections on the quality of the fits. The most\nfavored model is the beta=0.5 model, which produces a fit significantly better\nthan the No Flow assumption, consistent with previous peculiar velocity\nstudies. By comparing the No Flow assumption with the favored models we derive\nthe largest potential systematic error in w caused by ignoring peculiar\nvelocities to be Delta w = +0.04. For Omega_Lambda, the potential error is\nDelta Omega_Lambda = -0.04 and for Omega_m, the potential error is Delta\nOmega_m < +0.01. The favored flow model (beta=0.5) produces the following\ncosmological parameters: w = -1.08 (+0.09,-0.08), Omega_m = 0.27 (+0.02,-0.02)\nassuming a flat cosmology, and Omega_Lambda = 0.80 (+0.08,-0.07) and Omega_m =\n0.27 (+0.02,-0.02) for a w = -1 (LambdaCDM) cosmology.\n"

    "abstract": "  It is known that within the interacting electron model Hamiltonian for the\none-dimensional 1/4-filled band, the singlet ground state is a Wigner crystal\nonly if the nearest neighbor electron-electron repulsion is larger than a\ncritical value. We show that this critical nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction\nis different for each spin subspace, with the critical value decreasing with\nincreasing spin. As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there can\noccur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls\nstate that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from\nthe Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from\nthe spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by\nchanges in site charge densities. We apply our theory to the 1/4-filled band\nquasi-one-dimensional organic charge-transfer solids in general and to 2:1\ntetramethyltetrathiafulvalene (TMTTF) and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene\n(TMTSF) cationic salts in particular. We believe that many recent experiments\nstrongly indicate the Wigner crystal to Bond-Charge-Density Wave transition in\nseveral members of the TMTTF family. We explain the occurrence of two different\nantiferromagnetic phases but a single spin-Peierls state in the generic phase\ndiagram for the 2:1 cationic solids. The antiferromagnetic phases can have\neither the Wigner crystal or the Bond-Charge-Spin-Density Wave charge\noccupancies. The spin-Peierls state is always a Bond-Charge-Density Wave.\n"

These changes of the\ncharacteristics of the GRB flow translate into changing gamma-ray spectra from\nthe photosphere of the flow. The photospheric interpretation of the GRB\nemission explains the observed narrowing of GRB pulses with increasing photon\nenergy and the luminosity-spectral peak relation within and among bursts.\n"

    "title": "The VVDS type-1 AGN sample: The faint end of the luminosity function",
    "abstract": "  In a previous paper (Gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) sample obtained from the first epoch data of the\nVIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). The sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line AGN\nwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5< I <24.0, selected on the basis of their\nspectra. In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical Luminosity\nFunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results with\nprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Our\ndata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow us\nto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. By\ncombining our faint VVDS sample with the large sample of bright AGN extracted\nfrom the SDSS DR3 (Richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of different\nevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents the\ncombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, is\na luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, similar to those derived\nfrom the major X-surveys. Such a parameterization allows the redshift of the\nAGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains the\nexcess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5. On the basis of this model we\nfind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, that\nthe peak of the AGN space density shifts significantly towards lower redshift\ngoing to lower luminosity objects. This result, already found in a number of\nX-ray selected samples of AGN, is consistent with a scenario of \"AGN cosmic\ndownsizing\", in which the density of more luminous AGN, possibly associated to\nmore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the Universe, than\nthat of low luminosity ones.\n"

    "abstract": "  A critique of the singularity theorems of Penrose, Hawking, and Geroch is\ngiven. It is pointed out that a gravitationally collapsing black hole acts as\nan ultrahigh energy particle accelerator that can accelerate particles to\nenergies inconceivable in any terrestrial particle accelerator, and that when\nthe energy $E$ of the particles comprising matter in a black hole is $\\sim\n10^{2}, GeV$ or more, or equivalently, the temperature $T$ is $\\sim 10^{15}, K$\nor more, the entire matter in the black hole is converted into quark-gluon\nplasma permeated by leptons. As quarks and leptons are fermions, it is\nemphasized that the collapse of a black-hole to a space-time singularity is\ninhibited by Pauli's exclusion principle. It is also suggested that ultimately\na black hole may end up either as a stable quark star, or as a pulsating quark\nstar which may be a source of gravitational radiation, or it may simply explode\nwith a mini bang of a sort.\n"

We introduce a kinetically constrained lattice gas model that preserves\nthe connectivity of the chain, and we use this kinetically constrained model to\nstudy the dynamics of the polymer at varying densities through Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Even at densities close to the fully-packed configuration, we find\nthat the monomers comprising the chain manage to diffuse around the box with a\nroot mean square displacement of the order of the box dimensions over time\nscales for which the overall geometry of the polymer is, nevertheless, largely\npreserved. To capture this shape persistence, we define the local tangent field\nand study the two-time tangent-tangent correlation function, which exhibits a\nglass-like behavior. In both closed and open chains, we observe reptational\nmotion and reshaping through local fingering events which entail global monomer\ndisplacement.\n"

    "abstract": "  We have measured the flux, profile, color, and substructure in the diffuse\nintracluster light (ICL) in a sample of ten galaxy clusters with a range of\nmass, morphology, redshift, and density. Deep, wide-field observations for this\nproject were made in two bands at the one meter Swope and 2.5 meter du Pont\ntelescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Careful attention in reduction and\nanalysis was paid to the illumination correction, background subtraction, point\nspread function determination, and galaxy subtraction. ICL flux is detected in\nboth bands in all ten clusters ranging from 7.6 x 10^{10}, to 7.0 x 10^{11},\nh^{-1}, solar luminosities in r and 1.4 x 10^{10}, to 1.2 x 10^{11}, h^{-1}, solar\nluminosities in the B-band. These fluxes account for 6 to 22% of the total\ncluster light within one quarter of the virial radius in r and 4 to 21% in the\nB-band. Average ICL B-r colors range from 1.5 to 2.8 mags when k and evolution\ncorrected to the present epoch. In several clusters we also detect ICL in group\nenvironments near the cluster center and up to ~1 h^{-1}, Mpc distant from the\ncluster center. Our sample, having been selected from the Abell sample, is\nincomplete in that it does not include high redshift clusters with low density,\nlow flux, or low mass, and it does not include low redshift clusters with high\nflux, mass, or density. This bias makes it difficult to interpret correlations\nbetween ICL flux and cluster properties. Despite this selection bias, we do\nfind that the presence of a cD galaxy corresponds to both centrally\nconcentrated galaxy profiles and centrally concentrated ICL profiles. This is\nconsistent with ICL either forming from galaxy interactions at the center, or\nforming at earlier times in groups and later combining in the center.\n"

For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or\ntranscription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels\nof downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to\ninvestigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks.\nSpecifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,\nand noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the\nanalogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the\nexactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer\nsystem, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the\nabundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic\nnetwork. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in\ndifferent nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,\nfluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate\nelsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely\nshared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study\nmetabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networks\nwhich are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for\nbioinformatic analysis of metabolimic data are discussed.\n"

    "abstract": "  Context. Searching for planets in open clusters allows us to study the\neffects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.\n  Aims. Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellar\nmetallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searched\nfor close-in planets using the transit technique.\n  Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\\'artir telescope (2.1m),\nand the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probability\nwe also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observational\ncampaign. Adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetary\ntransits was achieved.\n  Results. Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791\nbe similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailed\nsimulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. Instead, we do not\nconfirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003). The\nprobability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence is\nestimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.\n  Conclusions. Possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:\n(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smaller\nplanetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)\nlimitations in the basic assumptions. More extensive photometry with 3-4m class\ntelescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency of\nplanets in NGC 6791.\n"

    "abstract": "  A significant fraction of Lyman Alpha (Lya) emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z>\n5.7 have rest-frame equivalent widths (EW) greater than ~100 Angstrom. However\nonly a small fraction of the Lya flux produced by a galaxy is transmitted\nthrough the IGM, which implies intrinsic Lya EWs that are in excess of the\nmaximum allowed for a population-II stellar population having a Salpeter mass\nfunction. In this paper we study characteristics of the sources powering Lya\nemission in high redshift galaxies. We propose a simple model for Lya emitters\nin which galaxies undergo a burst of very massive star formation that results\nin a large intrinsic EW, followed by a phase of population-II star formation\nwith a lower EW. We confront this model with a range of high redshift\nobservations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe the\nfollowing eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population with\nplausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of star\nformation: i-iv) the UV and Lya luminosity functions of LAEs at z=5.7 and 6.5,\nv-vi) the mean and variance of the EW distribution of Lya selected galaxies at\nz=5.7, vii) the EW distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) the\nobserved correlation of stellar age with EW. Our modeling suggests that the\nobserved anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of very\nmassive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of the\ngalaxies star forming lifetime. This very massive star formation may indicate\nthe presence of population-III star formation in a few per cent of i-drop\ngalaxies, and in about half of the Lya selected galaxies.\n"

Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or\nsearching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a\nspecific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an\ninsect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not\nrelevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim\nthat users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in\nthe form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this\nmetadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search\nperformance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision\nby filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network\nthat includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic\nmodel that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics\ncontained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be\ndescribed by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics\nfound by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding\nimages on topics that are of interest to the user.\n"

We allow the jet to have a non-vanishing mass at threshold, which\nmost closely corresponds to the situation in experiment. Matching our results\nto available semi-analytical next-to-leading-order calculations, we derive\nresummed results valid to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We present\nnumerical results for the resummation effects at Tevatron and RHIC energies.\n"

We prove\nthat Bimatrix, the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in a two-player game,\nis complete for the complexity class PPAD Polynomial Parity Argument, Directed\nversion) introduced by Papadimitriou in 1991.\n  This is the first of a series of results concerning the complexity of Nash\nequilibria. In particular, we prove the following theorems:\n  Bimatrix does not have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme unless\nevery problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time. The smoothed complexity\nof the classic Lemke-Howson algorithm and, in fact, of any algorithm for\nBimatrix is not polynomial unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in\nrandomized polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that, even in the simplest\nform of non-cooperative games, equilibrium computation and approximation are\npolynomial-time equivalent to fixed point computation. Our results also have\ntwo broad complexity implications in mathematical economics and operations\nresearch: Arrow-Debreu market equilibria are PPAD-hard to compute. The P-Matrix\nLinear Complementary Problem is computationally harder than convex programming\nunless every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time.\n"

    "abstract": "  The role of the equation of state for a perfectly conducting, relativistic\nmagnetized fluid is the main subject of this work. The ideal constant\n$\\Gamma$-law equation of state, commonly adopted in a wide range of\nastrophysical applications, is compared with a more realistic equation of state\nthat better approximates the single-specie relativistic gas. The paper focus on\nthree different topics. First, the influence of a more realistic equation of\nstate on the propagation of fast magneto-sonic shocks is investigated. This\ncalls into question the validity of the constant $\\Gamma$-law equation of state\nin problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes across\nhydromagnetic waves. Second, we present a new inversion scheme to recover\nprimitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservative\nones that allows for a general equation of state and avoids catastrophic\nnumerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits.\nFinally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (including\nmagnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared using\ndifferent equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of a\nrealistic equation of state can considerably bear upon the solution when\ntransitions from cold to hot gas (or viceversa) are present. Under these\ncircumstances, a polytropic equation of state can significantly endanger the\nsolution.\n"

    "abstract": "  In this paper, we model the evolution and self-assembly of randomly oriented\ncarbon nanotubes (CNTs), grown on a metallic substrate in the form of a thin\nfilm for field emission under diode configuration. Despite high output, the\ncurrent in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paper\nis focused on understanding this problem. A systematic, multiphysics based\nmodelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model for\ndegradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed to\ndecay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of the\nCNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain the\nself-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force\nare employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at\nthe device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation and\nintegration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. The\nsimulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results. Based\non the developed model, numerical simulations aimed at understanding the\neffects of various geometric parameters and their statistical features on the\ndevice current history are reported.\n"

    "abstract": "  The unusual properties of transition objects (young stars with an optically\nthin inner disc surrounded by an optically thick outer disc) suggest that\nsignificant disc evolution has occured in these systems. We explore the nature\nof these systems by examining their demographics, specifically their stellar\naccretion rates (Mdot) and disc masses (Mdisc) compared to those of accreting T\nTauri stars of comparable age. We find that transition objects in Taurus occupy\na restricted region of the Mdot vs. Mdisc plane. Compared to non-transition\nsingle stars in Taurus, they have stellar accretion rates that are typically\n~10 times lower at the same disc mass and median disc masses ~4 times larger.\nThese properties are anticipated by several proposed planet formation theories\nand suggest that the formation of Jovian mass planets may play a significant\nrole in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects. Considering\ntransition objects as a distinct demographic group among accreting T Tauri\nstars leads to a tighter relationship between disc masses and stellar accretion\nrates, with a slope between the two quantities that is close to the value of\nunity expected in simple theories of disc accretion.\n"

    "abstract": "  Reflectance, transmittance and absorbance of a symmetric light pulse, the\ncarrying frequency of which is close to the frequency of interband transitions\nin a quantum well, are calculated. Energy levels of the quantum well are\nassumed discrete, and two closely located excited levels are taken into\naccount. A wide quantum well (the width of which is comparable to the length of\nthe light wave, corresponding to the pulse carrying frequency) is considered,\nand the dependance of the interband matrix element of the momentum operator on\nthe light wave vector is taken into account. Refractive indices of barriers and\nquantum well are assumed equal each other. The problem is solved for an\narbitrary ratio of radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic\nexcitations. It is shown that the spatial dispersion essentially affects the\nshapes of reflected and transmitted pulses. The largest changes occur when the\nradiative broadening is close to the difference of frequencies of interband\ntransitions taken into account.\n"

Where the energy density\nof the ISRF is high (e.g., the Galactic Centre), the dominant gamma-ray\nemission in individual supernova remnants (SNRs), such as G0.9+0.1, may come\nfrom inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the ISRF. Several models of the ISRF\nexist. The most recent one, which has been calculated by us, predicts a\nsignificantly higher ISRF than the well-used model of Mathis, Mezger, and\nPanagia. However,comparison with data is limited to local observations. Based\non our current estimate of the ISRF we predict the gamma-ray emission in the\nSNRs G0.9+0.1 and RXJ1713, and pair-production absorption features above 20 TeV\nin the spectra of G0.9+0.1, J1713-381, and J1634-472.

Bi-intuitionistic logic was introduced by\nRauszer as a Hilbert calculus with algebraic and Kripke semantics. But her\nsubsequent ``cut-free'' sequent calculus for BiInt has recently been shown by\nUustalu to fail cut-elimination. We present a new cut-free sequent calculus for\nBiInt, and prove it sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics.\nEnsuring completeness is complicated by the interaction between implication and\nits dual, similarly to future and past modalities in tense logic. Our calculus\nhandles this interaction using extended sequents which pass information from\npremises to conclusions using variables instantiated at the leaves of failed\nderivation trees. Our simple termination argument allows our calculus to be\nused for automated deduction, although this is not its main purpose.\n"

On the basis of the\nkink mechanism the temperature dependence of the flow stress is described for a\nwide class of materials. The theory of quantum mechanical dislocation\ntunnelling through the Peierls-Nabarro barriers is extended and compared with\nexperimental data on the plasticity of alkali halides, BCC and HCP metals at\nlow temperatures. The behavior of the flow stress at the range of athermic\nanomalies is modeled by changing the mechanism of the dislocation motion from\nthe thermally activated hopping over the barriers to the quantum tunnelling\nthrough them. Some results of previous calculations are represented in a more\nexplicit convenient for applications form. The pronounced effect of the\nswitching between the normal and the superconducting states on the flow stress\nof metals is explained on the basis of the change in the dissipative properties\nof the electron subsystem affecting the dislocation motion.\n"

The magnetic field in SNRs is\nassumed to be significantly amplified by the efficiently accelerating nuclear\nCR component. It is shown that the calculated CR spectra agree in a\nsatisfactory way with the existing measurements up to the energy $10^{17},$ eV.\nThe power law spectrum of protons extends up to the energy $3\\times 10^{15},$ eV\nwith a subsequent exponential cutoff. It gives a natural explanation for the\nobserved knee in the Galactic CR spectrum. The maximum energy of the\naccelerated nuclei is proportional to their charge number $Z$. Therefore the\nbreak in the Galactic CR spectrum is the result of the contribution of\nprogressively heavier species in the overall CR spectrum so that at $10^{17},$\neV the CR spectrum is dominated by iron group nuclei.

These states are known to play an\nimportant role in the perturbative treatment of one-dimensional transverse\nIsing model with frustrated second-neighbour interaction. To calculate the\ncorrelation, we follow the earlier procedure of Wu, use Szego's theorem and\nalso use Fisher-Hartwig conjecture. The result is that the correlation decays\nalgebraically with distance ($n$) as $1/\\surd n$ and is oscillatory or\nnon-oscillatory depending on the magnitude of the transverse field.\n"

The spectral function shows a single resonance peak which\nbecomes wider and then disappears as the temperature is increased beyond 450\nMeV or so. This behaviour can be compared with recently attempted lattice\nreconstructions of the same quantity, based on the ``maximum entropy method'',\nwhich generically show several peaks. We also specify the dependence of our\nresults on the spatial momentum of the electromagnetic current, as well as on\nthe baryon chemical potential characterising the hot QCD plasma.\n"

In this paper, the third of the series, we report the\nresults of a dedicated optical spectroscopy campaign that, together with\nresults from other independent optical follow up programs, led to the\nspectroscopic identification of all sources in the sample. We carried out a\nsystematic spectroscopic campaign for the observation of all unidentified\nobjects of the sample using the ESO 3.6m, the KPNO 4m, and the TNG optical\ntelescopes. We present new identifications and optical spectra for 76 sources,\n50 of which are new BL Lac objects, 18 are sources previously referred as BL\nLacs but for which no redshift information was available, and 8 are broad\nemission lines AGNs. We find that the multi-frequency selection technique used\nto build the survey is highly efficient (about 90%) in selecting BL Lacs\nobjects. We present positional and spectroscopic information for all confirmed\nBL Lac objects. Our data allowed us to determined 36 redshifts out of the 50\nnew BL Lacs and 5 new redshifts for the previously known objects. The redshift\ndistribution of the complete sample is presented and compared with that of\nother BL Lacs samples. For 26 sources without recognizable absorption features,\nwe calculated lower limits to the redshift using a method based on simulated\noptical spectra with different ratios between jet and galaxy emission. For a\nsubsample of 38 object with high-quality spectra, we find a correlation between\nthe optical spectral slope, the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity, and the Ca H&K break\nvalue, indicating that for powerful/beamed sources the optical light is\ndominated by the non-thermal emission from the jet.\n"

We apply the\nconstruction to some well-known groups, constructing previously unknown latin\nbitrades.

This paper focuses on one\ntheoretical issue of this development which is concerned with oscillatory\nbehavior of a viscoelastic solid globe in the regime of quasistatic,\nforce-free, non-compressional oscillations less investigated in the literature\ncompared to oscillations in the regime of standing shear waves. We show that in\nthis case the problem of computing frequency and lifetime of spheroidal and\ntorsional modes of non-radial shear vibrations damped by viscosity can be\nunambiguously resolved by working from the energy balance equation and taking\nadvantage of the Rayleigh's variational method. The efficiency of this method\nis demonstrated by solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar\nastrophysics dealing with oscillations of a spherical mass of a viscoelastic\nFermi-solid with homogeneous and non-homogeneous profiles of the bulk density,\nthe shear modulus, and the shear viscosity.\n"

Due to the multi-atom\nnature of the ensemble it is capable of storing many spatial modes, a feature\ncritical for the present proposal. A quantum hologram has a higher storage\ncapacity compared to a classical hologram, and is capable of storing quantum\nfeatures of an image, such as multimode superposition and entangled quantum\nstates, something that a standard hologram is unable to achieve.

    "title": "Detection of a 1258 Hz high-amplitude kilohertz quasi-periodic\n  oscillation in the ultra-compact X-ray binary 1A 1246-588",
    "abstract": "  We have observed the ultra-compact low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 1A 1246-588\nwith the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). In this manuscript we report the\ndiscovery of a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in 1A 1246-588. The\nkilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux state\nreminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO\npeak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single\ntrial significance of more than 7 sigma. Kilohertz QPOs with a higher frequency\nhave only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09. Furthermore, the frequency\nis higher than that found for the lower kilohertz QPO in any source, strongly\nsuggesting that the QPO is the upper of the kilohertz QPO pair often found in\nLMXBs. The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence the\nhighest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpc\nfrom a radius expansion burst we derive that 1A 1246-588 is at a persistent\nflux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the Eddington flux, hence 1A 1246-588 is one of\nthe weakest LMXBs for which a kilohertz QPO has been detected. The\nroot-mean-square (rms) amplitude in the 5-60 keV band is 27+-3 per cent, this\nis the highest for any kilohertz QPO source so far, in line with the general\nanti-correlation between source luminosity and rms amplitude of the kilohertz\nQPO peak identified before. Using the X-ray spectral information we produce a\ncolour-colour diagram. The source behaviour in this diagram provides further\nevidence for the atoll nature of the source.\n"

In the case of smooth symmetric periodic potentials, we study\nanalytically bifurcations of SGS's from standard gap solitons and determine\nnumerically the maximal jump of the nonlinearity coefficient allowing for the\nSGS existence. We show that the maximal jump vanishes near the thresholds of\nbifurcations of gap solitons. In the case of continuous potentials with a jump\nin the first derivative at the interface, we develop a homotopy method of\ncontinuation of SGS families from the solution obtained via gluing of parts of\nthe standard gap solitons and study existence of SGS's in the photonic band\ngaps. We explain the termination of the SGS families in the interior points of\nthe band gaps from the bifurcation of linear bound states in the continuous\nnon-smooth potentials.\n"

This is a statistically well\ndefined sample of about 200 blazars and radio galaxies, most of which are\nexpected to be detected by GLAST. The second one is a new deep survey of\nBlazars selected among the radio sources that are spatially coincident with\nserendipitous sources detected in deep X-ray images (0.3-10 keV) centered on\nthe Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) discovered by the Swift satellite. This sample is\nparticularly interesting from a statistical viewpoint since a) it is unbiased\nas GRBs explode at random positions in the sky, b) it is very deep in the X-ray\nband (\\fx \\simgt $10^{-15},$ \\ergs) with a position accuracy of a few\narc-seconds, c) it will cover a fairly large (20-30 square deg.) area of sky,\nd) it includes all blazars with radio flux (1.4 GHz) larger than 10 mJy, making\nit approximately two orders of magnitude deeper than the WMAP sample and about\none order of magnitude deeper than the deepest existing complete samples of\nradio selected blazars, and e) it can be used to estimate the amount of\nunresolved GLAST high latitude gamma-ray background and its anisotropy\nspectrum.\n"

    "abstract": "  While most useful information theoretic inequalities can be deduced from the\nbasic properties of entropy or mutual information, up to now Shannon's entropy\npower inequality (EPI) is an exception: Existing information theoretic proofs\nof the EPI hinge on representations of differential entropy using either Fisher\ninformation or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), which are derived from de\nBruijn's identity. In this paper, we first present an unified view of these\nproofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing\nargument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an\nintegration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these\ningredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual\ninformation inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information\ninequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\\'u used in\nearlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it\nrelies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then\ngeneralized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder's\ngeneralized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and\nJohnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's\ncovariance-constrained EPI, and Costa's concavity inequality for the entropy\npower.\n"

    "abstract": "  This is the first in a series of papers in which we study vertex-algebraic\nstructure of Feigin-Stoyanovsky's principal subspaces associated to standard\nmodules for both untwisted and twisted affine Lie algebras. A key idea is to\nprove suitable presentations of principal subspaces, without using bases or\neven ``small'' spanning sets of these spaces. In this paper we prove\npresentations of the principal subspaces of the basic A_1^(1)-modules. These\nconvenient presentations were previously used in work of\nCapparelli-Lepowsky-Milas for the purpose of obtaining the classical\nRogers-Ramanujan recursion for the graded dimensions of the principal\nsubspaces.\n"

    "abstract": "  The properties of galaxies are strongly correlated with their environment,\nwith red galaxies dominating galaxy clusters and blue galaxies dominating the\ngeneral field. However, not all field galaxies are young: studies of the\ncolors, line strengths, and M/L ratios of massive early-type galaxies at\n0<z<1.3 show that the most massive galaxies do not seem to care about their\nsurroundings, and have very similar ages irrespective of their environment.\nThere is good evidence that the growth of these galaxies does continue longer\nin the field than in clusters, via (nearly) dissipationless mergers of already\nold galaxies. These results are consistent with predictions of recent galaxy\nformation models, which incorporate AGN feedback to suppress star formation in\nthe most massive halos. Systematic studies of the relation of galaxies with\ntheir environment beyond z=1 are difficult, and still somewhat contradictory.\nIntriguingly both the DEEP2 and VVDS surveys find that the color-density\nrelation disappears at z~1.3, unfortunately just at the point where both\nsurveys become highly incomplete. On the other hand, clustering studies at\nz~2.5 have shown that red galaxies cluster more strongly than blue galaxies,\nimplying that the color-density relation was already in place at that redshift.\n"

    "abstract": "  In this paper we outline some aspects of nonabelian gauged linear sigma\nmodels. First, we review how partial flag manifolds (generalizing\nGrassmannians) are described physically by nonabelian gauged linear sigma\nmodels, paying attention to realizations of tangent bundles and other aspects\npertinent to (0,2) models. Second, we review constructions of Calabi-Yau\ncomplete intersections within such flag manifolds, and properties of the gauged\nlinear sigma models. We discuss a number of examples of nonabelian GLSM's in\nwhich the Kahler phases are not birational, and in which at least one phase is\nrealized in some fashion other than as a complete intersection, extending\nprevious work of Hori-Tong. We also review an example of an abelian GLSM\nexhibiting the same phenomenon. We tentatively identify the mathematical\nrelationship between such non-birational phases, as examples of Kuznetsov's\nhomological projective duality. Finally, we discuss linear sigma model moduli\nspaces in these gauged linear sigma models. We argue that the moduli spaces\nbeing realized physically by these GLSM's are precisely Quot and hyperquot\nschemes, as one would expect mathematically.\n"

The considered\nmechanism involves two types of iron minerals (magnetite and maghemite) which\nwere found in subcellular compartments within sensory dendrites of the upper\nbeak of several bird species. The analysis of forces acting between the iron\nparticles shows that the orientation of the external geomagnetic field can\nsignificantly change the probability of the mechanosensitive ion channels\nopening and closing. The performed theoretical analysis shows that the\nsuggested magnetoreceptor system might be a sensitive biological magnetometer\nproviding an essential part of the magnetic map for navigation.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present mid-IR spectral decomposition of a sample of 48 Spitzer-selected\nULIRGs spanning z~1-3 and likely L_IR~10^12-10^13Lsun. Our study aims at\nquantifying the star-formation and AGN processes in these sources which recent\nresults suggest have evolved strongly between the observed epoch and today. To\ndo this, we study the mid-IR contribution of PAH emission, continuum, and\nextinction. About 3/4 of our sample are continuum- (i.e. AGN) dominated\nsources, but ~60% of these show PAH emission, suggesting the presence of\nstar-formation activity. These sources have redder mid-IR colors than typical\noptically-selected quasars. About 25% of our sample have strong PAH emission,\nbut none are likely to be pure starbursts as reflected in their relatively high\n5um hot dust continua. However, their steep 30um-to-14um slopes suggest that\nstar-formation might dominate the total infrared luminosity. Six of our z~2\nsources have EW6.2>~0.3um and L_14um>~10^12Lsun (implying L_IR>~10^13Lsun). At\nthese luminosities, such high EW6.2 ULIRGs do not exist in the local Universe.\nWe find a median optical depth at 9.7um of <tau_9.7>=1.4. This is consistent\nwith local IRAS-selected ULIRGs, but differs from early results on\nSCUBA-selected z~2 ULIRGs. Similar to local ULIRGs about 25% of our sample show\nextreme obscuration (tau_9.7>~3) suggesting buried nuclei. In general, we find\nthat our sources are similar to local ULIRGs, but are an order of magnitude\nmore luminous. It is not clear whether our z~2 ULIRGs are simply scaled-up\nversions of local ULIRGs, or subject to fundamentally different physical\nprocesses.\n"

We have identified\nnew low mass companions to the planet host stars HD101930 and HD65216.\nHD101930AB is a wide binary systems composed of the planet host star HD101930A\nand its companion HD101930B which is a M0 to M1 dwarf with a mass of about\n0.7Msun separated from the primary by ~73arcsec (2200AU projected separation).\nHD65216 forms a hierarchical triple system, with a projected separation of\n253AU (angular separation of about 7arcsec) between the planet host star\nHD65216A and its close binary companion HD65216BC, whose two components are\nseparated by only ~0.17arcsec (6AU of projected separation). Two VLT-NACO\nimages separated by 3 years confirm that this system is co-moving to the planet\nhost star. The infrared photometry of HD65216B and C is consistent with a M7 to\nM8 (0.089Msun), and a L2 to L3 dwarf (0.078Msun), respectively, both close to\nthe sub-stellar limit. An infrared spectrum with VLT-ISAAC of the pair\nHD65216BC, even though not resolved spatially, confirms this late spectral\ntype. Furthermore, we present H- and K-band ISAAC infrared spectra of HD16141B,\nthe recently detected co-moving companion of the planet host star HD16141A. The\ninfrared spectroscopy as well as the apparent infrared photometry of HD16141B\nare both fully consistent with a M2 to M3 dwarf located at the distance of the\nplanet host star.\n"

Input uncertainty is propagated into output uncertainty, reflecting\nthat option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on. Option\npricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional not only on how close\nthe model represents reality, but also on the quality of the inputs they use,\nand those inputs are usually not observable. We provide three alternative\nframeworks to calibrate option pricing tree models, propagating parameter\nuncertainty into the resulting option prices. We finally compare our methods\nwith classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no options\nmarket established. These methods can be applied to pricing of instruments for\nwhich there is not an options market, as well as a methodological tool to\naccount for parameter and model uncertainty in theoretical option pricing.\n"

    "abstract": "  We study the population of satellite galaxies formed in a suite of\nN-body/gasdynamical simulations of galaxy formation in a LCDM universe. We find\nlittle spatial or kinematic bias between the dark matter and the satellite\npopulation. The velocity dispersion of the satellites is a good indicator of\nthe virial velocity of the halo: \\sigma_{sat},/V_{vir},=0.9 +/- 0.2. Applied to\nthe Milky Way and M31 this gives V_{vir},^{MW},=109 +/- 22$ km/s and\nV_{vir},^{M31}, = 138 +/- 35 km/s, respectively, substantially lower than the\nrotation speed of their disk components. The detailed kinematics of simulated\nsatellites and dark matter are also in good agreement. By contrast, the stellar\nhalo of the simulated galaxies is kinematically and spatially distinct from the\npopulation of surviving satellites. This is because the survival of a satellite\ndepends on mass and on time of accretion; surviving satellites are biased\ntoward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. Our\nresults support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differences\nbetween stars in the Galactic halo and in Galactic satellites: the elusive\n``building blocks'' of the Milky Way stellar halo were on average more massive,\nand were accreted (and disrupted) earlier than the population of dwarfs that\nhas survived self-bound until the present.\n"

    "abstract": "  The space velocities from the catalog of Nordstrom et al. (2004) are used to\ntrace variations of a number of kinematic parameters of single F and G dwarfs\nas a function of their age. The vertex deviation of disk stars increases from\n7+- 1 to 15+-2 degrees as the mean age decreases from 4.3 to 1.5 Gyr. The\ntwo-dimensional velocity distributions in the UV, UW, and VW planes are\nanalyzed. The evolution of the main peaks in the velocity distributions can be\nfollowed to an average age of approximately 9 Gyr. We find that: (1) in the\ndistributions of the UV velocity components, stars of different types are\nconcentrated toward several stable peaks (the Hyades, Pleiades, and Sirius\nCluster), suggesting that the stars belonging to these formations did not form\nsimultaneously; (2) the peak associated with the Hyades Cluster dominates in\nall age intervals; and (3) the Hyades peak is strongest for stars with an\naverage age of 1.5 Gyr, suggesting that this peak contains a considerable\nfraction of stars from the Hyades cluster. The age dependences of the kinematic\nparameters exhibit a break near 4.5 Gyr, which can be explained as an effect of\nthe different contributions of stars of the thin and thick disks. The Stromberg\nrelation yields a solar LSR velocity of V_{\\odot LSR}, = (8.7, 6.2, 7.2)+- (0.5,\n2.2, 0.8) km/s.\n"

Most satellites follow conventional orbits; after turning around,\nthey accrete into their host halo and settle on orbits whose apocentric radii\nare steadily eroded by dynamical friction. However, a number of outliers are\nalso present, we find that ~1/3 of satellites identified at $z=0$ are on\nunorthodox orbits, with apocenters that exceed their turnaround radii. This\npopulation of satellites on extreme orbits consists typically of the faint\nmember of a satellite pair that has been ejected onto a highly-energetic orbit\nduring its first approach to the primary. Since the concurrent accretion of\nmultiple satellite systems is a defining feature of hierarchical models of\ngalaxy formation, we speculate that this three-body ejection mechanism may be\nthe origin of (i) some of the newly discovered high-speed satellites around M31\n(such as Andromeda XIV); (ii) some of the distant fast-receding Local Group\nmembers, such as Leo I; and (iii) the oddly isolated dwarf spheroidals Cetus\nand Tucana in the outskirts of the Local Group. Our results suggest that care\nmust be exercised when using the orbits of the most weakly bound satellites to\nplace constraints on the total mass of the Local Group.\n"

The dynamical model parameters are fixed by experimental\ndata for the magnetic moments of the baryon octet, for the hyperon semileptonic\ndecay constants, and for the singlet axial-vector constant. The transition\nmagnetic moments $\\mu_{\\Lambda\\Sigma},$ and $\\mu_{N\\Delta},$ are well reproduced\nand other octet-decuplet and octet-antidecuplet transitions are predicted. In\nparticular, the present calculation of $\\mu_{\\Sigma\\Sigma^*},$ is found to be\nbelow the upper bound $0.82\\mu_N$ that the SELEX collaboration measured very\nrecently. The results explains consistently the recent findings of a new $N^*$\nresonance from the GRAAL and Tohoku LNS group. We also obtain the transition\naxial-vector constants for the $\\Theta^+\\to KN$ from which the decay width of\nthe $\\Theta^{+},$ pentaquark baryon is determined as a function of the\npion-nucleon sigma term $\\Sigma_{\\pi N},$. We investigate the dependence of the\ndecay width of the $\\Theta^{+},$ on the $g_{A},^{(0)},$, with the $g_{A},^{(0)},$\nvaried within the range of the experimental uncertainty. We show that a small\ndecay width of the $\\Theta^{+},\\to KN$, i.e. $\\Gamma_{\\Theta KN}, \\leq 1$ MeV, is\ncompatible with the values of all known semileptonic decays with the generally\naccepted value of $g_{A},^{(0)}, \\approx 0.3$ for the proton.\n"

Time-resolved optical\nspectroscopy and photometry were carried out to determine the properties of\nthis new cataclysmic variable progenitor pre-CV). The light curves of\nHS1857+5144 display a sinusoidal variation with a period of Porb=383.52 min and\npeak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.7 mag and 1.1 mag in the B-band and R-band,\nrespectively. The large amplitude of the brightness variation results from a\nreflection effect on the heated inner hemisphere of the companion star,\nsuggesting a very high temperature of the white dwarf. Our radial velocity\nstudy confirms the photometric period as the orbital period of the system. A\nmodel atmosphere fit to the spectrum of the white dwarf obtained at minimum\nlight provides limits to its mass and temperature of Mwd=~0.6-1.0 Msun and\nTwd=~70000-100000 K, respectively. The detection of HeII 4686 absorption\nclassifies the primary star of HS1857+5144 as a DAO white dwarf. Combining the\nresults from our spectroscopy and photometry, we estimate the mass of the\ncompanion star and the binary inclination to be Msec=~0.15-0.30 Msun and\ni=~45-55 deg, respectively. We classify HS1857+5144 as one of the youngest\npre-CV known to date. The cooling age of the white dwarf suggests that the\npresent system has just emerged from a common envelope phase ~10^5 yr ago.\nHS1857+5144 will start mass transfer within or below the 2-3h period gap.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present a formal model to represent and solve the unicast/multicast\nrouting problem in networks with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. To\nattain this, first we translate the network adapting it to a weighted graph\n(unicast) or and-or graph (multicast), where the weight on a connector\ncorresponds to the multidimensional cost of sending a packet on the related\nnetwork link: each component of the weights vector represents a different QoS\nmetric value (e.g. bandwidth, cost, delay, packet loss). The second step\nconsists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic\nProgramming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best\npaths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on\nthem (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems.\nMoreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics. At\nlast, we provide an implementation of the framework over scale-free networks\nand we suggest how the performance can be improved.\n"

We define this phase velocity by analogy to the de Broglie\nwave associated with a moving particle. Based on this construct we demonstrate\nthat the phase of the de Broglie waves further extended for stationary\nparticles is a relativistic invariant being the same for all corresponding\nobservers. Also the phase of the electromagnetic waves transporting energy at\nlight speed is a relativistic invariant. Therefore the universe and its matter\n/ energy may be seen as a superposition of waves propagating such that their\nphase is the same for all corresponding observers. The wave phase may replace\nthe time as an invariant and universal reference.\n"

We\nargue that besides existence (so called v-representability) and uniqueness\nthere is an important question of stability and chaos. Studying a 2-level\nsystem we find innocent, almost constant densities that cannot be constructed\nfrom any potential (non-existence). We further show via a Lyapunov analysis\nthat the mapping of densities on potentials has chaotic regions in this case.\nIn real space the situation is more subtle. V-representability is formally\nassured but the mapping is often chaotic making the actual construction of the\npotential almost impossible. The chaotic nature of the mapping, studied for the\nfirst time here, has serious consequences regarding the possibility of using\nTDDFT in real-time settings.\n"

Any hadron can be defined as a color-singlet\ncomposite system of qurks and gluons, the fundamental fields of qcd, while the\nlandscape of the hadronic spectrum is dominated by the fact that two quark\nflavors, u and d, are characterized by masses small compared to the fundamental\nscale of this theory. Measurements sensitive to the orbital angular momenta of\nthe color constituents of the nucleon display the interplay of chiral dynamics\nand confinement in a unique manner. This pageant can be explored by an\nevaluation, within the context of the Georgi-Manohar chiral quark model, of the\nnormalization of the orbital structure functions and the normalization of the\nBoer-Mulders functions for different quark flavors. The resolution structures\nin the chiral quark model represent an evaluation of Collins functions for a\nconfined system defined by the quantum numbers of the nucleon in the\nconstituent quark model. The orbital structure functions for antiquarks can\nalso be specified within the basic framework of this approach while the\nnormalization of the gluon orbital structure function requires some additional\nassumptions.\n"

    "abstract": "  The stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes is subject of a\nlong standing theoretical debate. According to the so called Mermin-Wagner\ntheorem, long wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order for 2D\ncrystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be\ncrumpled. These dangerous fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by\nanharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes making that a\ntwo-dimensional membrane can exist but should present strong height\nfluctuations. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal and the\nrecent experimental observation of ripples in freely hanging graphene makes\nthese issues especially important. Beside the academic interest, understanding\nthe mechanisms of stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic\ntransport in this material that is attracting so much interest for its unusual\nDirac spectrum and electronic properties. Here we address the nature of these\nheight fluctuations by means of straightforward atomistic Monte Carlo\nsimulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for\ncarbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear due to thermal fluctuations\nwith a size distribution peaked around 70 \\AA which is compatible with\nexperimental findings (50-100 \\AA) but not with the current understanding of\nstability of flexible membranes. This unexpected result seems to be due to the\nmultiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon.\n"

More\nimportantly, we show that any quadratic ${\\cal F},$-consistent nonlinear\nexpectation with a certain domination property must be a quadratic\n$g$-expectation. The main contribution of this paper is the finding of the\ndomination condition to replace the one used in all the previous works, which\nis no longer valid in the quadratic case. We also show that the representation\ngenerator must be deterministic, continuous, and actually must be of the simple\nform.\n"

    "abstract": "  This paper describes the appearance of abnormal film thickness features\nformed in elastohydrodynamic contacts lubricated by a fatty alcohol.\nExperiments were conducted by varying the slide to roll ratio between a steel\nball and a glass disk in a ball-on-disk type device. Lauric alcohol was used as\nlubricant and film thickness was measured in the contact area by optical\ninterferometry. Experimental results showed that the film thickness\ndistributions under pure rolling conditions remained classical whereas the film\nshape changed when the slide to roll ratio was increased. The thickness in the\ncentral contact area increased and in the same time inlet and exit film\nthicknesses were modified. In addition, the film shapes observed when the ball\nsurface was moving faster than the disk one and those obtained in the opposite\ncase were different, i.e. when opposite signs but equal absolute values of the\nslide to roll ratio were applied.\n"

This was accomplished by accurate\nmeasurements in viscometers of the shear response of a PAO that possesses a\nvery low critical stress for shear-thinning and accurate measurements\nin-contact of film thickness and traction under conditions which accentuate the\nshear-thinning effect. The in-contact central film thickness and traction were\nentirely predictable from the rheological properties obtained from viscometers\nusing simple calculations. These data should be invaluable to researchers\nendeavoring to accurately simulate Hertz zone behavior since the shear-thinning\nrheology is extensively characterized and accurate in-contact data are\navailable to test. In addition, a new model has been introduced that may be\nuseful for the rheological characterization of mixtures.\n"

    "abstract": "  After the pioneered experimental works on superlubricity by Martin et al. on\nMoS2 [1], Hirano et al. on tungsten and silicon [2] and the further\nconfirmation by Dienwiebel et al. on graphite [3], many groups around the word\ninvestigated the occurrence of near frictionless sliding contacts. This large\nmobilization of tribologists, material sciences specialists and physicists has\nlead to emerging solutions involving new materials and coatings, the most\npromising being carbon based like graphite, diamond, carbon composites or\ndiamond-like-carbons. Some of them are currently used in practical\napplications. The situation is different especially in EHL: the highest\nfriction coefficients are close to 10% when traction fluids are involved, i.e.\nfluids that have especially designed to transmit the highest friction, and they\nvary within 3-6% for the rest of lubricants. The range of variation is\nconsequently very narrow and these typical values are really low compared to\nthose obtained in dry contacts: as a consequence the gain expected from a super\nlow traction regime in lubrication will be probably more limited, especially in\nthe case of experiments conducted at the meso or macro scales. This weak\nperspective could be one explanation on the relatively low number of articles\nin recent literature dealing with lubricated superlubricity in the above\nconditions.\n"

    "abstract": "  The analysis of gravitational wave data involves many model selection\nproblems. The most important example is the detection problem of selecting\nbetween the data being consistent with instrument noise alone, or instrument\nnoise and a gravitational wave signal. The analysis of data from ground based\ngravitational wave detectors is mostly conducted using classical statistics,\nand methods such as the Neyman-Pearson criteria are used for model selection.\nFuture space based detectors, such as the \\emph{Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna}, (LISA), are expected to produced rich data streams containing the\nsignals from many millions of sources. Determining the number of sources that\nare resolvable, and the most appropriate description of each source poses a\nchallenging model selection problem that may best be addressed in a Bayesian\nframework. An important class of LISA sources are the millions of low-mass\nbinary systems within our own galaxy, tens of thousands of which will be\ndetectable. Not only are the number of sources unknown, but so are the number\nof parameters required to model the waveforms. For example, a significant\nsubset of the resolvable galactic binaries will exhibit orbital frequency\nevolution, while a smaller number will have measurable eccentricity. In the\nBayesian approach to model selection one needs to compute the Bayes factor\nbetween competing models. Here we explore various methods for computing Bayes\nfactors in the context of determining which galactic binaries have measurable\nfrequency evolution. The methods explored include a Reverse Jump Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm, Savage-Dickie density ratios, the Schwarz-Bayes\nInformation Criterion (BIC), and the Laplace approximation to the model\nevidence. We find good agreement between all of the approaches.\n"

    "abstract": "  A cascade model is described based on multiplier distributions determined\nfrom 3D direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent particle laden flows,\nwhich include two-way coupling between the phases at global mass loadings equal\nto unity. The governing Eulerian equations are solved using pseudo-spectral\nmethods on up to 512**3 computional grid points. DNS results for particle\nconcentration and enstrophy at Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers in the range\n34 - 170 were used to directly determine multiplier distributions (PDFs) on\nspatial scales 3 times the Kolmogorov length scale. The width of the PDFs,\nwhich is a measure of intermittency, decreases with increasing mass loading\nwithin the local region where the multipliers are measured. The functional form\nof this dependence is not sensitive to Reynolds numbers in the range\nconsidered. A partition correlation probability is included in the cascade\nmodel to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between particle\nconcentration and enstrophy. Joint probability distribution functions of\nconcentration and enstrophy generated using the cascade model are shown to be\nin excellent agreement with those derived directly from our 3D simulations.\nProbabilities predicted by the cascade model are presented at Reynolds numbers\nwell beyond what is achievable by direct simulation. These results clearly\nindicate that particle mass loading significantly reduces the probabilities of\nhigh particle concentration and enstrophy relative to those resulting from\nunloaded runs. Particle mass density appears to reach a limit at around 100\ntimes the gas density. This approach has promise for significant computational\nsavings in certain applications.\n"

This observation gives an operational\nmeaning to the finiteness of the entropy S_dS of an inflationary de Sitter\nspace eventually exiting into an asymptotically flat region: the asymptotic\nobserver is never able to measure more than e^(S_dS) independent inflationary\nmodes. This suggests a limitation on the amount of de Sitter space outside the\nhorizon that can be consistently described at the semiclassical level, fitting\nwell with other examples of the breakdown of locality in quantum gravity, such\nas in black hole evaporation. The bound does not hold in models of inflation\nthat violate the null energy condition, such as ghost inflation. This\nstrengthens the case for the thermodynamical interpretation of the bound as\nconventional black hole thermodynamics also fails in these models, strongly\nsuggesting that these theories are incompatible with basic gravitational\nprinciples.\n"

    "abstract": "  We report coincident damped Lyman alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA absorption at z =\n2.66 and z = 2.94 towards the z ~ 3 13.8 arcsecond separation binary quasar\nSDSS 1116+4118 AB. At the redshifts of the absorbers, this angular separation\ncorresponds to a proper transverse separation of ~ 110 kpc. A third absorber, a\nsub-DLA at z = 2.47, is detected towards SDSS 1116+4118 B, but no corresponding\nhigh column density absorber is present towards SDSS 1116+4118 A. We use high\nresolution galaxy simulations and a clustering analysis to interpret the\ncoincident absorption and its implications for galaxy structure at z ~ 3. We\nconclude that the common absorption in the two lines of sight is unlikely to\narise from a single galaxy, or a galaxy plus satellite system, and is more\nfeasibly explained by a group of two or more galaxies with separations ~ 100\nkpc. The impact of these findings on single line of sight observations is also\ndiscussed; we show that abundances of DLAs may be affected by up to a few\ntenths of a dex by line of sight DLA blending. From a Keck ESI spectrum of the\ntwo quasars, we measure metal column densities for all five absorbers and\ndetermine abundances for the three absorbers with log N(HI) > 20. For the two\nhighest N(HI) absorbers, we determine high levels of metal enrichment,\ncorresponding to 1/3 and 1/5 solar. These metallicities are amongst the highest\nmeasured for DLAs at any redshift and are consistent with values measured in\nLyman break galaxies at 2 < z < 3. For the DLA at z = 2.94 we also infer an\napproximately solar ratio of alpha-to-Fe peak elements from [S/Zn] = +0.05, and\nmeasure an upper limit for the molecular fraction in this particular line of\nsight of log f(H_2)< -5.5.\n"

    "abstract": "  Numerical simulations of Milky-Way size Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos predict\na steeply rising mass function of small dark matter subhalos and a substructure\ncount that greatly outnumbers the observed satellites of the Milky Way. Several\nproposed explanations exist, but detailed comparison between theory and\nobservation in terms of the maximum circular velocity (Vmax) of the subhalos is\nhampered by the fact that Vmax for satellite halos is poorly constrained. We\npresent comprehensive mass models for the well-known Milky Way dwarf\nsatellites, and derive likelihood functions to show that their masses within\n0.6 kpc (M_0.6) are strongly constrained by the present data. We show that the\nM_0.6 mass function of luminous satellite halos is flat between ~ 10^7 and 10^8\nM_\\odot. We use the ``Via Lactea'' N-body simulation to show that the M_0.6\nmass function of CDM subhalos is steeply rising over this range. We rule out\nthe hypothesis that the 11 well-known satellites of the Milky Way are hosted by\nthe 11 most massive subhalos. We show that models where the brightest\nsatellites correspond to the earliest forming subhalos or the most massive\naccreted objects both reproduce the observed mass function. A similar analysis\nwith the newly-discovered dwarf satellites will further test these scenarios\nand provide powerful constraints on the CDM small-scale power spectrum and warm\ndark matter models.\n"

Our first pair of\ntheorems establish that there exist codes from this ensemble, with all degrees\nremaining bounded independently of block length, that are simultaneously\noptimal as both source and channel codes when encoding and decoding are\nperformed optimally. More precisely, in the context of lossy compression, we\nprove that finite degree constructions can achieve any pair $(R, D)$ on the\nrate-distortion curve of the binary symmetric source. In the context of channel\ncoding, we prove that finite degree codes can achieve any pair $(C, p)$ on the\ncapacity-noise curve of the binary symmetric channel. Next, we show that our\ncompound construction has a nested structure that can be exploited to achieve\nthe Wyner-Ziv bound for source coding with side information (SCSI), as well as\nthe Gelfand-Pinsker bound for channel coding with side information (CCSI).\nAlthough the current results are based on optimal encoding and decoding, the\nproposed graphical codes have sparse structure and high girth that renders them\nwell-suited to message-passing and other efficient decoding procedures.\n"

Such models are conjectured to be dual to 4D\nstrong dynamics triggering EWSB. The motivation for such a study is that a\nnegative value of S can significantly ameliorate the constraints from\nelectroweak precision data on these models, allowing lower mass scales (TeV or\nbelow) for the new particles and leading to easier discovery at the LHC. We\nfirst extend an earlier proof of S>0 for EWSB by boundary conditions in\narbitrary metric to the case of general kinetic functions for the gauge fields\nor arbitrary kinetic mixing. We then consider EWSB in the bulk by a Higgs VEV\nshowing that S is positive for arbitrary metric and Higgs profile, assuming\nthat the effects from higher-dimensional operators in the 5D theory are\nsub-leading and can therefore be neglected. For the specific case of AdS_5 with\na power law Higgs profile, we also show that S ~ + O(1), including effects of\npossible kinetic mixing from higher-dimensional operator (of NDA size) in the\n$5D$ theory. Therefore, our work strongly suggests that S is positive in\ncalculable models in extra dimensions.\n"

    "abstract": "  Unbiased angular diameter measurements are required for accurate distances to\nCepheids using the interferometric Baade Wesselink method (IBWM). The precision\nof this technique is currently limited by interferometric measurements at the\n1.5% level. At this level, the center-to-limb darkening (CLD) and the presence\nof circumstellar envelopes (CSE) seem to be the two main sources of bias. The\nobservations we performed aim at improving our knowledge of the interferometric\nvisibility profile of Cepheids. In particular, we assess the systematic\npresence of CSE around Cepheids in order determine accurate distances with the\nIBWM free from CSE biased angular diameters. We observed a Cepheid (Y Oph) for\nwhich the pulsation is well resolved and a non-pulsating yellow supergiant\n(alpha Per) using long-baseline near-infrared interferometry. We interpreted\nthese data using a simple CSE model we previously developed. We found that our\nobservations of alpha Per do not provide evidence for a CSE. The measured CLD\nis explained by an hydrostatic photospheric model. Our observations of Y Oph,\nwhen compared to smaller baseline measurements, suggest that it is surrounded\nby a CSE with similar characteristics to CSE found previously around other\nCepheids. We have determined the distance to Y Oph to be d=491+/-18 pc.\nAdditional evidence points toward the conclusion that most Cepheids are\nsurrounded by faint CSE, detected by near infrared interferometry: after\nobserving four Cepheids, all show evidence for a CSE. Our CSE non-detection\naround a non-pulsating supergiant in the instability strip, alpha Per, provides\nconfidence in the detection technique and suggests a pulsation driven mass-loss\nmechanism for the Cepheids.\n"

The Enhanced Distributed Channel Access\n(EDCA) function of 802.11e defines multiple Access Categories (AC) with\nAC-specific Contention Window (CW) sizes, Arbitration Interframe Space (AIFS)\nvalues, and Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) limits to support MAC-level QoS and\nprioritization. We propose an analytical model for the EDCA function which\nincorporates an accurate CW, AIFS, and TXOP differentiation at any traffic\nload. The proposed model is also shown to capture the effect of MAC layer\nbuffer size on the performance. Analytical and simulation results are compared\nto demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach for varying traffic loads,\nEDCA parameters, and MAC layer buffer space.\n"

Strong electron itinerancy\nin this charge-transfer system significantly delocalizes the occupied\nlow-energy \"Mn$^{3+},$\" Wannier states such that charge leaks into the\n\"Mn$^{4+},$\"-sites.

The electron-electron interaction is found to play a role as\nimportant as the electron-lattice interaction. \\ignore{A general picture of\ndoped holes in strongly correlated charge-transfer systems is presented and\napplied to the study of charge order in half-doped manganites, using a novel\nWannier states analysis of the LDA$+U$ electronic structure. While residing\nprimarily in the oxygen atoms, the doped holes form additional effective $e_g$\norbitals at the low-energy scale, leading to an effective Mn$^{3+},$/Mn$^{4+},$\nvalence picture that enables weak charge disproportion, resolving the current\nserious contradictions between the recent experimental observations of charge\ndistribution and traditional models.

Coefficients are\nextracted by considering two-particle and triple unitarity cuts of the\ncorresponding bubble and triangle integral functions. After choosing a specific\nparameterisation of the cut loop momentum we can uniquely identify the\ncoefficients of the desired integral functions simply by examining the\nbehaviour of the cut integrand as the unconstrained parameters of the cut loop\nmomentum approach infinity. In this way we can produce compact forms for scalar\nintegral coefficients. Applications of this method are presented for both QCD\nand electroweak processes, including an alternative form for the recently\ncomputed three-mass triangle coefficient in the six-photon amplitude\n$A_6(1^-,2^+,3^-,4^+,5^-,6^+)$. The direct nature of this extraction procedure\nallows for a very straightforward automation of the procedure.\n"

    "abstract": "  We investigate the dissipation of magnetic flux in primordial star-forming\nclouds throughout their collapse including the run-away collapse phase as well\nas the accretion phase. We solve the energy equation and the non-equilibrium\nchemical reactions in the collapsing gas, in order to obtain the radial\ndistribution of the ionized fraction during the collapse. As a result, we find\nthe ionized fraction is high enough for the magnetic field to couple with the\ngas throughout the evolution of the cloud. This result suggests that the jet\nformation from protostars as well as the activation of magneto-rotational\ninstability in the accretion disk are enabled in the presence of the\ncosmological seed magnetic flux proposed by Langer et al.(2003).\n"

    "abstract": "  Recently, we discussed the first example of a phenomenologically realistic\nintersecting D6-brane model. In this model, the gauge symmetry in the hidden\nsector is USp(2)_1 x USp(2)_2 x USp(2)_3 x USp(2)_4. However, we find that the\nUSp(2)_1 x USp(2)_2 gauge symmetry can be replaced by an U(2)_{12}, gauge\nsymmetry, and/or the USp(2)_3 x USp(2)_4 gauge symmetry can be replaced by an\nU(2)_{34}, gauge symmetry since the USp(2)^2 stacks of D6-branes contribute to\nthe same Ramond-Ramond tadpoles as those of the U(2) stacks. Thus, there are\nthree non-equivalent variations of the hidden sector, and the corresponding\ngauge symmetries are U(2)_{12}, x USp(2)_3 x USp(2)_4, U(2)_{34}, x USp(2)_1 x\nUSp(2)_2, and U(2)_{12}, x U(2)_{34},, respectively. Moreover, we study the\nhidden sector gauge symmetry breaking, discuss how to decouple the additional\nexotic particles, and briefly comment on the phenomenological consequences.\n"

    "abstract": "  An end-grafted flexible polymer chain in 3d space between two pistons\nundergoes an abrupt transition from a confined coil to a flower-like\nconformation when the number of monomers in the chain, N, reaches a critical\nvalue. In 2d geometry, excluded volume interactions between monomers of a chain\nconfined inside a strip of finite length 2L transform the coil conformation\ninto a linear string of blobs. However, the blob picture raises questions on\nthe nature of this escape transition. To check the theoretical predictions\nbased on the blob picture we study 2d single polymer chains with excluded\nvolume interactions and with one end grafted in the middle of a strip of length\n  2L and width H by simulating self-avoiding walks on a square lattice with the\npruned-enriched-Rosenbluth method (PERM). We estimate the free energy, the\nend-to-end distance, the number of imprisoned monomers, the order parameter,\nand its distribution. It is shown that in the thermodynamic limit of large N\nand L but finite L/N, there is a small but finite jump in several average\ncharacteristics, including the order parameter. We also present a theoretical\ndescription based on the Landau free energy approach, which is in good\nagreement with the simulation results. Both simulation results and the\nanalytical theory indicate that the 2d escape transition is a weak first-order\nphase transition.\n"

    "abstract": "  Supermassive black hole (BH) masses (MBH) are strongly correlated with galaxy\nstellar bulge masses (Mbulge) and there are several ideas to explain the origin\nof this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from\nconsiderations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear\nBH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of how\nprimordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function\ndeclines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation\nis a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation\nbecause of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for\ngalaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and\na convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A\ncurious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are\nformed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would\ncorrelate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger\ncentral-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some\nother physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge\nrelationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random\nmerging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather\nthan weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized\nto other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclear\nobjects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.\n"

    "abstract": "  We simulate EM pulse propagation along the nonuniform earth surface using so\ncalled time-domain parabolic equation. To solve it by finite differences, we\nintroduce a time-domain analog of the impedance boundary condition and a\nnonlocal BC of transparency reducing open computational domain to a strip of\nfinite width. Numerical examples demonstrate influence of soil conductivity on\nthe wide-band pulse waveform. For a high-frequency modulated EM pulse, we\ndevelop an asymptotic approach based on the ray structure of the monochromatic\nwave field at carrier frequency. This radically diminishes the computation\ncosts and allows for pulsed wave field calculation in vast domains measured by\ntens of thousands wavelengths.\n"

    "title": "Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory: Kinetic Potentials and Ab-Initio\n  Local Pseudopotentials",
    "abstract": "  In the density functional (DF) theory of Kohn and Sham, the kinetic energy of\nthe ground state of a system of noninteracting electrons in a general external\nfield is calculated using a set of orbitals. Orbital free methods attempt to\ncalculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the\nuniversal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local\napproximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise\ngenerally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic\npotential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in\nthe Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic\npotential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated\napproximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the\nvalue of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two\nnonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for\nboth slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact\nresults for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to\nsmall perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate\nand weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varying\nvalence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital free\nDF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these local\npseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kinetic\npotentials. Our theory yields results for the total energies and ionization\nenergies of atoms, and for the shell structure in the atomic radial density\nprofiles that are in very good agreement with calculations using the full\nKohn-Sham theory.\n"

    "abstract": "  The \"power of choice\" has been shown to radically alter the behavior of a\nnumber of randomized algorithms. Here we explore the effects of choice on\nmodels of tree and network growth. In our models each new node has k randomly\nchosen contacts, where k > 1 is a constant. It then attaches to whichever one\nof these contacts is most desirable in some sense, such as its distance from\nthe root or its degree. Even when the new node has just two choices, i.e., when\nk=2, the resulting network can be very different from a random graph or tree.\nFor instance, if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to the\nroot of the tree, the distribution of depths changes from Poisson to a\ntraveling wave solution. If the new node attaches to the contact with the\nsmallest degree, the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a random\ngraph, so that with high probability there are no nodes in the network with\ndegree greater than O(log log N). Finally, if the new node attaches to the\ncontact with the largest degree, we find that the degree distribution is a\npower law with exponent -1 up to degrees roughly equal to k, with an\nexponential cutoff beyond that; thus, in this case, we need k >> 1 to see a\npower law over a wide range of degrees.\n"

    "abstract": "  BACKGROUND: An important question is whether evolution favors properties such\nas mutational robustness or evolvability that do not directly benefit any\nindividual, but can influence the course of future evolution. Functionally\nsimilar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and\ncapacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of\nthese differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.\n  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution\nfavors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently\nlarge. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection\npressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that\nproteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards\nhigher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve\ngreater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both\nmutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and\nstability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be\nquantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral\nnetwork.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general\ntendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in\nhighly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute\nto the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that\nexist in large populations.\n"

It has been shown, when the statistics of CuO chain\nformation was described in terms of two dimensional asymmetric next-to-nearest\nneighbor Ising (ASYNNNI) model, that at any constant temperature below the top\nof OII phase there exists a uniquely defined value of critical chain length\nlcr(T) that yields a constant doping p(x)=const over the regime of OII phase\n(related to 60K plateau of Tc(x)), while 90K plateau coincides with the\nmonotonously increasing p(x) over optimal doping level p=0.16 in the regime of\nOI phase. Short length chains (l<lcr(T)), together with the first lcr(T)-2\nholes in longer chains (l>lcr(T)), are taken as not capable of attracting\nelectrons from CuO2 planes.. It is shown that only a part (41%) of the\nremaining l-lcr(T)+1 holes in the long chains can capture electrons.

    "abstract": "  Normal-incidence transmission and dispersion properties of optical\nmultilayers and one-dimensional stepwise potential barriers in the\nnon-tunneling regime are analytically investigated. The optical paths of every\nconstituent layer in a multilayer structure, as well as the parameters of every\nstep of the stepwise potential barrier, are constrained by a generalized\nquarter-wave condition. No other restrictions on the structure geometry is\nimposed, i.e., the layers are arranged arbitrarily. We show that the density of\nstates (DOS) spectra of the multilayer or barrier in question are subject to\nintegral conservation rules similar to the Barnett-Loudon sum rule but ocurring\nwithin a finite frequency or energy interval. In the optical case, these\nfrequency intervals are regular. For the potential barriers, only non-periodic\nenergy intervals can be present in the spectrum of any given structure, and\nonly if the parameters of constituent potential steps are properly chosen.\n  Abstract The integral conservation relations derived analytically have also\nbeen verified numerically. The relations can be used in dispersion-engineered\nmultilayer-based devices, e.g., ultrashort pulse compressors or ultracompact\noptical delay lines, as well as to design multiple-quantum-well electronic\nheterostructures with engineered DOS.\n"

Rotation is thought to be vital in the creation of\nLGRBs, and it is likely that black hole creation is also necessary. We suggest\nthat these two constraints can be met if the GRB progenitors are very massive\nstars (>20 solar masses) and are formed in tight binary systems. Using simple\nmodels we compare the predictions of this scenario with observations and find\nthat the location of GRBs on their host galaxies are suggestive of\nmain-sequence masses in excess of 20 solar masses, while 50% of the known\ncompact binary systems may have been sufficiently close to have had the\nnecessary rotation rates for GRB creation. Thus, massive stars in compact\nbinaries are a likely channel for at least some fraction of LGRBs.\n"

In this\ncurrent work, a parametric study was carried out on both reaction and catalyst\nconditions. Results revealed that a thin Fe catalyst layer (about 0.5 nm)\nyielded rapid growth of SWNTs only when supported on Al2O3, and that Al2O3\nsupport enhanced the activity of Fe, Co, and Ni catalysts. The growth window\nfor the rapid SWNT growth was narrow, however. Optimum amount of added H2O\nincreased the SWNT growth rate but further addition of H2O degraded both the\nSWNT growth rate and quality. Addition of H2 was also essential for rapid SWNT\ngrowth, but again, further addition decreased both the SWNT growth rate and\nquality. Because Al2O3 catalyzes hydrocarbon reforming, Al2O3 support possibly\nenhances the SWNT growth rate by supplying the carbon source to the catalyst\nnanoparticles. The origin of the narrow window for rapid SWNT growth will also\nbe discussed.\n"

Based on the corresponding quantum\nFriedmann equation and the scalar field equation of motion, we calculate the\nquantum radiative corrections to the scalar spectral index n_s, gravitational\nwave spectral index n_g and the ratio r of tensor to scalar perturbations. When\ncompared with the standard (tree-level) values, we find that the quantum\ncontributions are suppressed by lambda N^2 where N denotes the number of\ne-foldings. Hence there is an N^2 enhancement with respect to the naive\nexpectation, which is due to the infrared enhancement of scalar vacuum\nfluctuations characterising de Sitter space. Since observations constrain\nlambda to be very small lambda ~ 10^(-12) and N ~ 50-60, the quantum\ncorrections in this inflationary model are unobservably small.\n"

We choose MgO as a\nprototype closed-shell ionic oxide. Our analysis is based on a local\nHamiltonian approach and performed on finite fragments cut from the infinite\nsolid. Localized Wannier functions and embedding potentials are obtained from\nprior periodic Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations. We investigate the role of\nvarious electron correlation effects in reducing the HF band gap and modifying\nthe band widths. On-site and nearest-neighbor charge relaxation as well as\nlong-range polarization effects are calculated. Whereas correlation effects are\nessential for computing accurate band gaps, we found that they produce smaller\nchanges on the HF band widths, at least for this material. Surprisingly, a\nbroadening effect is obtained for the O 2p valence bands. The ab initio data\nare in good agreement with the energy gap and band width derived from\nthermoreflectance and x-ray photoemission experiments. The results show that\nthe wavefunction based approach applied here allows for well controlled\napproximations and a transparent identification of the microscopic processes\nwhich determine the electronic band structure.\n"

The pulsation of the objects has been\nmodelled, yielding stellar masses, and spectral synthesis calculations have\nbeen performed in order to derive abundances from the observed spectra. For two\nstars, abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Ti, Sc and Fe were derived and compared\nwith the abundances predicted by detailed AGB models. Both stars show very\nlarge N enhancements and C deficiencies. These results provide the first\nobservational confirmation of the long-predicted production of primary nitrogen\nby the combination of third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning in\nintermediate-mass AGB stars. It was not possible to derive abundances for the\nremaining five stars: three were too cool to model, while another two had\nstrong shocks in their atmospheres which caused strong emission to fill the\nline cores and made abundance determination impossible. The latter occurrence\nallows us to predict the pulsation phase interval during which observations\nshould be made if successful abundance analysis is to be possible.\n"

We discuss in detail the periodic flux modulations arising from the\ntidal force on the star due to a substellar companion. An analytic expression\nfor the variability is derived in the equilibrium-tide approximation. We\ndemonstrate analytically and through numerical solutions of the linear,\nnonadiabatic stellar oscillation equations that the equilibrium-tide formula\nworks extremely well for stars of mass <1.4 Msun with thick surface convection\nzones. More massive stars with largely radiative envelopes do not conform to\nthe equilibrium-tide approximation and can exhibit flux variations $\\ga$10\ntimes larger than naive estimates. Over the full range of stellar masses\nconsidered, we treat the oscillatory response of the convection zone by\nadapting a prescription that A. J. Brickhill developed for pulsating white\ndwarfs. Compared to other sources of periodic variability, the ellipsoidal\nlightcurve has a distinct dependence on time and system parameters.

    "title": "Thermal inertia of near-Earth asteroids and implications for the\n  magnitude of the Yarkovsky effect",
    "abstract": "  Thermal inertia determines the temperature distribution over the surface of\nan asteroid and therefore governs the magnitude the Yarkovsky effect. The\nlatter causes gradual drifting of the orbits of km-sized asteroids and plays an\nimportant role in the delivery of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from the main\nbelt and in the dynamical spreading of asteroid families. At present, very\nlittle is known about the thermal inertia of asteroids in the km size range.\nHere we show that the average thermal inertia of a sample of NEAs in the\nkm-size range is 200 $\\pm$ 40 J m&#8722;2 s&#8722;0.5 K&#8722;1. Furthermore,\nwe identify a trend of increasing thermal inertia with decreasing asteroid\ndiameter, D. This indicates that the dependence of the drift rate of the\norbital semimajor axis on the size of asteroids due to the Yarkovsky effect is\na more complex function than the generally adopted D^(&#8722;1) dependence, and\nthat the size distribution of objects injected by Yarkovsky-driven orbital\nmobility into the NEA source regions is less skewed to smaller sizes than\ngenerally assumed. We discuss how this fact may help to explain the small\ndifference in the slope of the size distribution of km-sized NEAs and main-belt\nasteroids.\n"

We want to determine whether the different\ndata sets are compatible between themselves and with models of the evolution of\nextrasolar planets. We simulate directly a population of stars corresponding to\nthe OGLE transit survey and assign them planetary companions based on radial\nvelocimetry discoveries. We use a model of the evolution and structure of giant\nplanets assuming a variable fraction of heavy elements. The output list of\ndetectable planets of the simulations is compared to the real detections. We\nconfirm that the radial velocimetry and photometric survey data sets are\ncompatible within the statistical errors, assuming that planets with periods\nbetween 1 and 2 days are approximately 5 times less frequent than planets with\nperiods between 2 and 5 days. We show that evolution models fitting present\nobservational constraints predict a lack of small giant planets with large\nmasses. We also identify distinct populations of planets: those with short\nperiods (P < 10d) are only found in orbit around metal-rich stars with [Fe/H] >\n-0.07. We further confirm the relative absence of low-mass giant planets at\nsmall orbital distances.\n"

    "abstract": "  Diskoseismology, the theoretical study of small adiabatic hydrodynamical\nglobal perturbations of geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disks\naround black holes (and other compact objects), is a potentially powerful probe\nof the gravitational field. For instance, the frequencies of the normal mode\noscillations can be used to determine the elusive angular momentum parameter of\nthe black hole. The general formalism developed by diskoseismologists for\nrelativistic systems can be readily applied to the Newtonian case of\ncataclysmic variables (CVs). Some of these systems (e.g., the dwarf nova SS\nCygni) show rapid oscillations in the UV with periods of tens of seconds and\nhigh coherence. In this paper, we assess the possibility that these dwarf nova\noscillations (DNOs) are diskoseismic modes. Besides its importance in\ninvestigating the physical origin of DNOs, the present work could help us to\nanswer the following question. To what extent are the similarities in the\noscillation phenomenology of CVs and X-ray binaries (XRBs) indicative of a\ncommon physical mechanism?\n"

The quadrupole\norigin of the inorganic part of the quadrupole-dipole hybrid provides inversion\nsymmetry breaking and the organic part contributes to the oscillator strength\nof the hybrid. We show that the enhancement of the SHG, compared to bulk\ncuprous oxide crystal, is proportional to the ratio of the DCM2 dipole moment\nand the effective dipole moment of the quadrupole transitions in the cuprous\noxide. It is also inversely proportional to the line-width of the hybrid and\nbulk excitons. The enhancement may be regulated by adjusting the organic blend\n(mutual concentration of the DCM2 and CA part of the solvent) and pumping\nconditions(varying the angle of incidence in case of optical pumping or\npopulating the minimum of the lower branch of the hybrid in case of electrical\npumping).\n"

    "abstract": "  In spatially distributed multiuser antenna systems, the received signal\ncontains multiple carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs) arising from mismatch\nbetween the oscillators of transmitters and receivers. This results in a\ntime-varying rotation of the data constellation, which needs to be compensated\nat the receiver before symbol recovery. In this paper, a new approach for blind\nCFO estimation and symbol recovery is proposed. The received base-band signal\nis over-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) problem. By applying blind MIMO system\nestimation techniques, the system response can be estimated and decoupled\nversions of the user symbols can be recovered, each one of which contains a\ndistinct CFO. By applying a decision feedback Phase Lock Loop (PLL), the CFO\ncan be mitigated and the transmitted symbols can be recovered. The estimated\nMIMO system response provides information about the CFOs that can be used to\ninitialize the PLL, speed up its convergence, and avoid ambiguities usually\nlinked with PLL.\n"

In our\nprevious work we have shown that to the second-order perturbations, the density\nand velocity perturbation equations of general relativistic zero-pressure,\nirrotational, single-component fluid in a flat background coincide exactly with\nthe ones known in Newton's theory. Here, we present the general relativistic\nsecond-order correction terms arising due to (i) pressure, (ii)\nmulti-component, (iii) background curvature, and (iv) rotation. In case of\nmulti-component zero-pressure, irrotational fluids under the flat background,\nwe effectively do not have relativistic correction terms, thus the relativistic\nresult again coincides with the Newtonian ones. In the other three cases we\ngenerally have pure general relativistic correction terms. In case of pressure,\nthe relativistic corrections appear even in the level of background and linear\nperturbation equations. In the presence of background curvature, or rotation,\npure relativistic correction terms directly appear in the Newtonian equations\nof motion of density and velocity perturbations to the second order.

    "abstract": "  We compute solutions of the Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model\n(LANS) for significantly higher Reynolds numbers (up to Re 8300) than have\npreviously been accomplished. This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.\n"

    "title": "On the measurement problem for a two-level quantum system",
    "abstract": "  A geometric approach to quantum mechanics with unitary evolution and\nnon-unitary collapse processes is developed. In this approach the Schrodinger\nevolution of a quantum system is a geodesic motion on the space of states of\nthe system furnished with an appropriate Riemannian metric. The measuring\ndevice is modeled by a perturbation of the metric. The process of measurement\nis identified with a geodesic motion of state of the system in the perturbed\nmetric. Under the assumption of random fluctuations of the perturbed metric,\nthe Born rule for probabilities of collapse is derived. The approach is applied\nto a two-level quantum system to obtain a simple geometric interpretation of\nquantum commutators, the uncertainty principle and Planck's constant. In light\nof this, a lucid analysis of the double-slit experiment with collapse and an\nexperiment on a pair of entangled particles is presented.\n"

    "abstract": "  The main goal of this work is to investigate the possibility of finding the\nsupersymmetric version of the U(1)-global string model which behaves as a\nvortex-superfluid. To describe the superfluid phase, we introduce a\nLorentz-symmetry breaking background that, in an approach based on\nsupersymmetry, leads to a discussion on the relation between the violation of\nLorentz symmetry and explicit soft supersymmetry breakings. We also study the\nrelation between the string configuration and the vortex-superfluid phase. In\nthe framework we settle down in terms of superspace and superfields, we\nactually establish a duality between the vortex degrees of freedom and the\ncomponent fields of the Kalb-Ramond superfield. We make also considerations\nabout the fermionic excitations that may appear in connection with the vortex\nformation.\n"

Changing the initial distributions of rotation\nand magnetic fields prior to collapse in a parametric manner, we compute 19\nmodels. By so doing, we systematically investigate how rotation and magnetic\nfields affect the collapse dynamics and explore how the properties of the\nblack-hole formations and neutrino emissions could be affected. As for the\nmicrophysics, we employ a realistic equation of state and approximate the\nneutrino transfer by a multiflavour leakage scheme. With these computations, we\nfind that the jet-like explosions are obtained by the magnetodriven shock waves\nif the initial magnetic field is as large as $10^{12},$ G. We point out that the\nblack-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, on\nthe other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. As for the neutrino\nproperties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays an\nimportant role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is more\ndominant than the others. Furthermore, we find that the stronger magnetic\nfields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magnetic\npressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to the\nsuppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.\n"

Rime solutions include the standard\nDrinfeld-Jimbo R-matrix. Solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation within the rime\nAnsatz which are maximally different from the standard one we call \"strict\nrime\". A strict rime non-unitary solution is parameterized by a projective\nvector. We show that this solution transforms to the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix\nby a change of basis with a matrix containing symmetric functions in the\ncomponents of the parameterizing vector. A strict unitary solution (the rime\nAnsatz is well adapted for taking a unitary limit) is shown to be equivalent to\na quantization of a classical \"boundary\" r-matrix of Gerstenhaber and\nGiaquinto. We analyze the structure of the elementary rime blocks and find, as\na by-product, that all non-standard R-matrices of GL(1|1)-type can be uniformly\ndescribed in a rime form.\n  We discuss then connections of the classical rime solutions with the Bezout\noperators. The Bezout operators satisfy the (non-)homogeneous associative\nclassical Yang--Baxter equation which is related to the Rota-Baxter operators.\n  We classify the rime Poisson brackets: they form a 3-dimensional pencil. A\nnormal form of each individual member of the pencil depends on the discriminant\nof a certain quadratic polynomial. We also classify orderable quadratic rime\nassociative algebras.\n  For the standard Drinfeld-Jimbo solution, there is a choice of the\nmultiparameters, for which it can be non-trivially rimed. However, not every\nBelavin-Drinfeld triple admits a choice of the multiparameters for which it can\nbe rimed. We give a minimal example.\n"

    "abstract": "  It has been shown that the luminosity of AGNs and the size of their broad\nline region obey a simple relation of the type R=a L^g, from faint Seyfert\nnuclei to bright quasars, allowing single-epoch determination of the central\nblack hole mass M=b L^g D^2 from their luminosity L and width of H_beta\nemission line. Adopting this mass determination for cosmological studies\nrequires the extrapolation to high z and L of a relation whose calibration\nrelies so far on reverberation mapping measurements performed for L<10^46 erg/s\nand z<0.4. We initiated a campaign for the monitoring of a few luminous,\nintermediate z quasars whose apparent magnitude V<15.7 allows observations with\na 1.8m telescope, aimed at proving that emission lines vary and respond to\ncontinuum variations even for luminosities >10^47 erg/s, and determining\neventually their M_BH from reverberation mapping. We have repeatedly performed\nsimultaneous observations of quasars and reference stars to determine relative\nvariability of continuum and emission lines. We describe the observations and\nmethods of analysis. For the quasars PG1634+706 and PG1247+268 we obtain\nlight-curves respectively for CIII], MgII and for CIV, CIII] emission lines\nwith the relevant continua. During 3.2 years of observation, in the former case\nno continuum variability has been detected and the evidence for line\nvariability is marginal, while in the latter case both continuum and line\nvariability are detected with high significance and the line variations appear\ncorrelated with continuum variations. The detection of the emission line\nvariability in a quasar with L~10^47 erg/s encourages the prosecution of the\ncampaign which should provide a black hole mass estimate in other 5-6 years,\nconstraining the M_BH-L relation in a poorly explored range of luminosity.\n"

Considering\nthis, we study the general effective interactions of photons with spin-zero\nparticles without restricting the latter to be a pseudo-scalar or a scalar,\ni.e., a parity eigenstate. At the lowest order in effective field theory, there\nare two dimension-5 interactions, each of which has previously been treated\nseparately for a pseudo-scalar or a scalar particle. By following the evolution\nin an external magnetic field of the system of spin-zero particles and photons,\nwe compute the changes in light polarization and the transition probability for\ntwo experimental set-ups: one-way propagation and round-trip propagation. While\nthe first may be relevant for astrophysical sources of spin-zero particles, the\nsecond applies to laboratory optical experiments like PVLAS. In the one-way\npropagation, interesting phenomena can occur for special configurations of\npolarization where, for instance, transition occurs but light polarization does\nnot change. For the round-trip propagation, however, the standard results of\npolarization changes for a pseudoscalar or a scalar are only modified by a\nfactor that depends on the relative strength of the two interactions.\n"

The new photometry supports cluster membership for most of them, with\nless than 15% of the previous candidates identified as probable non-members.\nThe near infrared photometry allows us to identify stars with IR excesses, and\nwe find that the Class II population is very large, around 25% for stars (in\nthe spectral range M0 - M6.5) and 40% for brown dwarfs, down to 0.04 Msun,\ndespite the fact that the H(alpha) equivalent width is low for a significant\nfraction of them. In addition, there are a number of substellar objects,\nclassified as Class III, that have optically thin disks. The Class II members\nare distributed in an inhomogeneous way, lying preferentially in a filament\nrunning toward the south-east. The IR excesses for the Collinder 69 members\nrange from pure Class II (flat or nearly flat spectra longward of 1 micron), to\ntransition disks with no near-IR excess but excesses beginning within the IRAC\nwavelength range, to two stars with excess only detected at 24 micron.\nCollinder 69 thus appears to be at an age where it provides a natural\nlaboratory for the study of primordial disks and their dissipation.\n"

However, to obtain high\nmatching performances for larger binary masses, we need to either extend this\nfamily to unphysical regions of the parameter space or introduce a 4PN order\ncoefficient in the frequency-domain GW phase. Finally, we find that the\nphenomenological Buonanno-Chen-Vallisneri family has FFs >= 0.97 with total\nmass M=10 ~ 120Msun.

    "abstract": "  Massive merging black holes will be the primary sources of powerful\ngravitational waves at low frequency, and will permit to test general\nrelativity with candidate galaxies close to a binary black hole merger. In this\npaper we identify the typical mass ratio of the two black holes but then show\nthat the distance when gravitational radiation becomes the dominant dissipative\neffect (over dynamical friction) does not depend on the mass ratio. However the\ndynamical evolution in the gravitational wave emission regime does. For the\ntypical range of mass ratios the final stage of the merger is preceded by a\nrapid precession and a subsequent spin-flip of the main black hole. This\nalready occurs in the inspiral phase, therefore can be described analytically\nby post-Newtonian techniques. We then identify the radio galaxies with a\nsuper-disk as those in which the rapidly precessing jet produces effectively a\npowerful wind, entraining the environmental gas to produce the appearance of a\nthick disk. These specific galaxies are thus candidates for a merger of two\nblack holes to happen in the astronomically near future.\n"

    "abstract": "  We report on the frequency performance of a low cost (~500$) radio-frequency\nsine wave generator, using direct digital synthesis (DDS) and a\nfield-programmable gate array (FPGA). The output frequency of the device may be\nchanged dynamically to any arbitrary value ranging from DC to 10 MHz without\nany phase slip. Sampling effects are substantially reduced by a high sample\nrate, up to 1 MHz, and by a large memory length, more than 2.10^5 samples. By\nusing a low noise external oscillator to clock the DDS, we demonstrate a phase\nnoise as low as that of the master clock, that is at the level of -113\ndB.rad^2/Hz at 1 Hz from the carrier for an output frequency of 3.75 MHz. The\ndevice is successfully used to confine an ultracold atomic cloud of rubidium 87\nin a RF-based trap, and there is no extra heating from the RF source.\n"

    "abstract": "  A new framework for asset price dynamics is introduced in which the concept\nof noisy information about future cash flows is used to derive the price\nprocesses. In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure.\nEach cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a\nfunction of a collection of independent random variables called market factors.\nWith each such \"X-factor\" we associate a market information process, the values\nof which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of\ntwo terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor;\nthe other represents \"noise\". The noise term is modelled by an independent\nBrownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the\naggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is\ngiven by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral\nmeasure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When\nthe cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit\nmodel is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on\ndividend-paying assets are derived. Remarkably, the resulting formula for the\nprice of a European call option is of the Black-Scholes-Merton type. The\ninformation-based framework also generates a natural explanation for the origin\nof stochastic volatility.\n"

An overlap\nfactor is introduced to characterize the symmetry breaking of M_F=\\pm 1\ncomponents for the F=1 ferromagnetic condensate. We demonstrate that the domain\nformation is a co-effect of the quantum coherence and the thermal relaxation. A\nthermally enhanced quantum-oscillation is observed during the dynamical process\nof the domain formation. And the spatial separation of domains leads to\nsignificant decay of the M_F=0 component fraction in an initial M_F=0\ncondensate.\n"

Negative temperature is based on the Kelvin\nscale and the condition dU>0 and dS<0. Conversely, there is also negative\ntemperature for dU<0 and dS>0. But, negative temperature is contradiction with\nusual meaning of temperature and with some basic concepts of physics and\nmathematics. It is a question in nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

    "abstract": "  A scale invariant model containing dilaton $\\phi$ and dust (as a model of\nmatter) is studied where the shift symmetry $\\phi\\to\\phi +const.$ is\nspontaneously broken at the classical level due to intrinsic features of the\nmodel. The dilaton to matter coupling \"constant\" $f$ appears to be dependent of\nthe matter density. In normal conditions, i.e. when the matter energy density\nis many orders of magnitude larger than the dilaton contribution to the dark\nenergy density, $f$ becomes less than the ratio of the \"mass of the vacuum\" in\nthe volume occupied by the matter to the Planck mass. The model yields this\nkind of \"Archimedes law\" without any especial (intended for this) choice of the\nunderlying action and without fine tuning of the parameters. The model not only\nexplains why all attempts to discover a scalar force correction to Newtonian\ngravity were unsuccessful so far but also predicts that in the near future\nthere is no chance to detect such corrections in the astronomical measurements\nas well as in the specially designed fifth force experiments on intermediate,\nshort (like millimeter) and even ultrashort (a few nanometer) ranges. This\nprediction is alternative to predictions of other known models.\n"

Secondary infall\nmodel provides a paradigm for the study of caustics in \"typical\" haloes\nassuming that they have had no major mergers and have grown only by smooth\naccretion. This is a particular characteristic of the smallest dark matter\nhaloes of about 10^{-5}, Mo, which although \"atypical\" contain no substructures\nand could have survived until now with no major mergers. Thus using this model\nas the first guidline, we evaluate the neutralino self-annihilation flux for\nthese haloes. Our results show that caustics could leave a distinct sawteeth\nsignature on the differential and cumulative fluxes coming from the outer\nregions of these haloes. The total annihilation signal from the regions away\nfrom the centre can be boosted by about forty percents.\n"

    "abstract": "  In this paper, we deal with a generalization of the geometry of\nparallelizable manifolds, or the absolute parallelism (AP-) geometry, in the\ncontext of generalized Lagrange spaces. All geometric objects defined in this\ngeometry are not only functions of the positional argument $x$, but also depend\non the directional argument $y$. In other words, instead of dealing with\ngeometric objects defined on the manifold $M$, as in the case of classical\nAP-geometry, we are dealing with geometric objects in the pullback bundle\n$\\pi^{-1},(TM)$ (the pullback of the tangent bundle $TM$ by $ \\pi: T\nM\\longrightarrow M$). Many new geometric objects, which have no counterpart in\nthe classical AP-geometry, emerge in this more general context. We refer to\nsuch a geometry as generalized AP-geometry (GAP-geometry). In analogy to\nAP-geometry, we define a $d$-connection in $\\pi^{-1},(TM)$ having remarkable\nproperties, which we call the canonical $d$-connection, in terms of the unique\ntorsion-free Riemannian $d$-connection. In addition to these two\n$d$-connections, two more $d$-connections are defined, the dual and the\nsymmetric $d$-connections. Our space, therefore, admits twelve curvature\ntensors (corresponding to the four defined $d$-connections), three of which\nvanish identically. Simple formulae for the nine non-vanishing curvatures\ntensors are obtained, in terms of the torsion tensors of the canonical\n$d$-connection. The different $W$-tensors admitted by the space are also\ncalculated. All contractions of the $h$- and $v$-curvature tensors and the\n$W$-tensors are derived. Second rank symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors,\nwhich prove useful in physical applications, are singled out.\n"

    "abstract": "  This paper is a detailed report on a programme of simulations used to settle\na long-standing issue in the dynamo theory and demonstrate that the fluctuation\ndynamo exists in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds number Rm>>1 and small\nmagnetic Prandtl number Pm<<1. The dependence of the critical Rm_c vs. the\nhydrodynamic Reynolds number Re is obtained for 1<Re<6700. In the limit Pm<<1,\nRm_c is ~3 times larger than for Pm>1. The stability curve Rm_c(Re) (and, it is\nargued, the nature of the dynamo) is substantially different from the case of\nthe simulations and liquid-metal experiments with a mean flow. It is not as yet\npossible to determine numerically whether the growth rate is ~Rm^{1/2}, in the\nlimit Re>>Rm>>1, as should be the case if the dynamo is driven by the\ninertial-range motions. The magnetic-energy spectrum in the low-Pm regime is\nqualitatively different from the Pm>1 case and appears to develop a negative\nspectral slope, although current resolutions are insufficient to determine its\nasymptotic form. At 1<Rm<Rm_c, the magnetic fluctuations induced via the\ntangling by turbulence of a weak mean field are investigated and the\npossibility of a k^{-1}, spectrum above the resistive scale is examined. At low\nRm<1, the induced fluctuations are well described by the quasistatic\napproximation; the k^{-11/3}, spectrum is confirmed for the first time in direct\nnumerical simulations.\n"

    "abstract": "  The dynamics of many socioeconomic systems is determined by the decision\nmaking process of agents. The decision process depends on agent's\ncharacteristics, such as preferences, risk aversion, behavioral biases, etc..\nIn addition, in some systems the size of agents can be highly heterogeneous\nleading to very different impacts of agents on the system dynamics. The large\nsize of some agents poses challenging problems to agents who want to control\ntheir impact, either by forcing the system in a given direction or by hiding\ntheir intentionality. Here we consider the financial market as a model system,\nand we study empirically how agents strategically adjust the properties of\nlarge orders in order to meet their preference and minimize their impact. We\nquantify this strategic behavior by detecting scaling relations of allometric\nnature between the variables characterizing the trading activity of different\ninstitutions. We observe power law distributions in the investment time\nhorizon, in the number of transactions needed to execute a large order and in\nthe traded value exchanged by large institutions and we show that heterogeneity\nof agents is a key ingredient for the emergence of some aggregate properties\ncharacterizing this complex system.\n"

We present HMMER-STRUCT, a model construction algorithm\nand tool that tries to improve pHMM performance by using structural information\nwhile training pHMMs. As a first step, HMMER-STRUCT constructs a set of pHMMs.\nEach pHMM is constructed by weighting each residue in an aligned protein\naccording to a specific structural property of the residue. Properties used\nwere primary, secondary and tertiary structures, accessibility and packing.\nHMMER-STRUCT then prioritizes the results by voting. Results: We used the SCOP\ndatabase to perform our experiments. Throughout, we apply leave-one-family-out\ncross-validation over protein superfamilies. First, we used the MAMMOTH-mult\nstructural aligner to align the training set proteins. Then, we performed two\nsets of experiments. In a first experiment, we compared structure weighted\nmodels against standard pHMMs and against each other. In a second experiment,\nwe compared the voting model against individual pHMMs. We compare method\nperformance through ROC curves and through Precision/Recall curves, and assess\nsignificance through the paired two tailed t-test. Our results show significant\nperformance improvements of all structurally weighted models over default\nHMMER, and a significant improvement in sensitivity of the combined models over\nboth the original model and the structurally weighted models.\n"

The first example concerns the quark-mass\ndependence of the baryon octet and decuplet masses. It is shown that within a\nself consistent one-loop approach based on the chiral Lagrangian the\n'mysterious' quark-mass dependence of the $\\Xi$ mass predicted by the MILC\ncollaboration may be recovered in terms of a discontinuous chiral\nextrapolation. This is a consequence of self consistency imposed on the partial\nsummation, i.e. the masses used in the loop functions are identical to those\nobtained from the baryon self energies. In the second example we discuss recent\nstudies on the properties of D mesons in cold nuclear matter as they are\npredicted by coupled-channel dynamics. Here a self consistent many-body\napproach reveals the close interlink of the properties of D meson and\nopen-charm baryon resonances in nuclear matter. The relevance of exotic baryon\nresonances for the spectral distortion of the $D_s^\\pm$ in nuclear matter is\npointed out.\n"

    "abstract": "  Standard game theory assumes that the structure of the game is common\nknowledge among players. We relax this assumption by considering extensive\ngames where agents may be unaware of the complete structure of the game. In\nparticular, they may not be aware of moves that they and other agents can make.\nWe show how such games can be represented; the key idea is to describe the game\nfrom the point of view of every agent at every node of the game tree. We\nprovide a generalization of Nash equilibrium and show that every game with\nawareness has a generalized Nash equilibrium. Finally, we extend these results\nto games with awareness of unawareness, where a player i may be aware that a\nplayer j can make moves that i is not aware of, and to subjective games, where\npayers may have no common knowledge regarding the actual game and their beliefs\nare incompatible with a common prior.\n"

    "abstract": "  It has long been speculated that supernova remnants represent a major source\nof cosmic rays in the Galaxy. Observations over the past decade have\nceremoniously unveiled direct evidence of particle acceleration in SNRs to\nenergies approaching the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum. Nonthermal X-ray\nemission from shell-type SNRs reveals multi-TeV electrons, and the dynamical\nproperties of several SNRs point to efficient acceleration of ions.\nObservations of TeV gamma-ray emission have confirmed the presence of energetic\nparticles in several remnants as well, but there remains considerable debate as\nto whether this emission originates with high energy electrons or ions. Equally\nuncertain are the exact conditions that lead to efficient particle\nacceleration.\n  Based on the catalog of EGRET sources, we know that there is a large\npopulation of Galactic gamma-ray sources whose distribution is similar to that\nof SNRs. With the increased resolution and sensitivity of GLAST, the gamma-ray\nSNRs from this population will be identified. Their detailed emission\nstructure, along with their spectra, will provide the link between their\nenvironments and their spectra in other wavebands to constrain emission models\nand to potentially identify direct evidence of ion acceleration in SNRs. Here I\nsummarize recent observational and theoretical work in the area of cosmic ray\nacceleration by SNRs, and discuss the contributions GLAST will bring to our\nunderstanding of this problem.\n"

Input values of gluon condensates at finite\ntemperature are extracted from lattice QCD data for the energy density and\npressure. Although stability of the moment ratio is achieved only up to T/Tc ~\n1.05, the gluon condensates cause a decrease of the moment ratio, which results\nin change of spectral properties. Using the Breit-Wigner form for the\nphenomenological side, we find that mass shift of J/psi just above Tc can reach\nmaximally 200 MeV and width can broaden to dozens of MeV.\n"

We\npresent a method for achieving this addition by performing a sequence of\nspatial rotations and uni-dimensional Lorentz transformations. The method is\nfirst developed for two-dimensional space and it is then extended to\nthree-dimensional space by utilizing the commutative property of the rotation\nof the y-z plane and a boost along the x-axis. The method employs only matrix\nmultiplication and certain invariant quantities that are natural consequences\nof spatial rotations and Lorentz transformations. The combining of two boosts\nin different directions into a single boost cannot be expected a priori because\nwe show that the converse of this statement is not true. That is, two rotations\ninterspersed with a boost cannot always be reduced to a single rotation\npreceded and followed by boosts.\n"

We\nexperimentally investigated the triboelectrification between two smooth\nmonocrystalline &#945;-Al 2O 3 (sapphire) antagonists by surface force\nmeasurements with a Surface Force Apparatus (SFA). The force between a sphere\nand a plane, both in sapphire, was measured as a function of the sphere-plane\ndistance D, before and after nano-friction tests, under dry argon atmosphere.\nRespective contributions of van der Waals, water meniscus and electrostatic\nforces were determined. The estimated Hamaker constant was in good agreement\nwith the Lifshitz theory, and the dominant meniscus attraction at low\nseparation could be overcome with small radius sphere. We demonstrated that\nelectrostatic forces were generated by the nano-friction test and we quantified\nthe adhesion that results from this contact-electrification. In the first stage\nof the unloading process, the short range electrostatic force was found to vary\nboth with time and distance D. Experimental results were correlated with\nsurface densities of mobile charges on the two surfaces, and the\ntime-dependence was related to classical surface transport phenomena on alumina\nsurfaces.\n"

Here we study the character rings \\CO and\n\\CSp of the orthogonal and symplectic subgroups of the general linear group\nwithin the same framework of symmetric functions. We show that \\CO and \\CSp\nalso admit natural Hopf algebra structures that are isomorphic to that of \\CGL,\nand hence to \\Sym. The isomorphisms are determined explicitly, along with the\nspecification of standard bases for \\CO and \\CSp analogous to those used for\n\\Sym. A major structural change arising from the adoption of these bases is the\nintroduction of new orthogonal and symplectic Schur-Hall scalar products.\nSignificantly, the adjoint with respect to multiplication no longer coincides,\nas it does in the \\CGL case, with a Foulkes derivative or skew operation. The\nadjoint and Foulkes derivative now require separate definitions, and their\nproperties are explored here in the orthogonal and symplectic cases. Moreover,\nthe Hopf algebras \\CO and \\CSp are not self-dual. The dual Hopf algebras \\CO^*\nand \\CSp^* are identified.

The\nchemical evolution models for Draco and Ursa Minor, which are able to reproduce\nseveral observational features of these two galaxies, such as the several\nabundance ratios, take up-to-date nucleosynthesis into account for\nintermediate-mass stars and supernovae of both types, as well as the effect of\nthese objects on the energetics of the systems. For both galaxies, the model\nthat best fits the data contains an intense continuous galactic wind, occurring\nat a rate proportional to the star formation rate. Models with a wind rate\nassumed to be proportional only to the supernova rate also reproduce the\nobserved SMD, but do not match the gas mass, whereas the models with no\ngalactic winds fail to reproduce the observed SMDs. In the case of Ursa Minor,\nthe same model as in previous works reproduces the observed distribution very\nwell with no need to modify the main parameters of the model. The model for\nDraco, on the other hand, is slightly modified. The observed SMD requires a\nmodel with a lower supernova type Ia thermalization efficiency ($\\eta_{SNeIa},$\n= 0.5 instead of $\\eta_{SNeIa},$ = 1.0) in order to delay the galactic wind,\nwhereas all the other parameters are kept the same. The model results, compared\nto observations, strongly suggest that intense and continuous galactic winds\nplay a very important role in the evolution of local dSphs.\n"

For benzene adsorbed on the clean Si surface the\ntight-bridge structure was found to be stable and the butterfly structure\nmetastable. Both carbonic acid H$_2$CO$_3$ and propane C$_3$H$_8$ dissociate on\ncontact with the surface. Passivation of the Si surface with H-atoms has a\ndramatic effect on the surface properties. The passivated surface is very inert\nand the binding energy of all the molecules is very weak.\n"

Given the competitive results of these devices, as\na result of their intrinsic insensitivity to backgrounds, we have developed a\nprototype trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I)-loaded SDD with increased sensitivity to\nspin-independent interactions as well. A low (0.102 kgd) exposure test\noperation of two high concentration, 1 liter devices is described, and the\nresults compared with leading experiments in both spin-dependent and\n-independent sectors. Although competitive in both sectors when the difference\nin exposures is accounted for, a problem with fracturing of the detector gel\nmust be addressed before significantly larger exposures can be envisioned.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present a novel comprehensive first-principles theoretical study of the\nelectronic properties and relative stabilities of edge-oxidized zigzag graphene\nnanoribbons. The oxidation schemes considered include hydroxyl, carboxyl,\nether, and ketone groups. Using screened exchange density functional theory, we\nshow that these oxidized ribbons are more stable than hydrogen-terminated\nnanoribbons except for the case of the etheric groups. The stable oxidized\nconfigurations maintain a spin-polarized ground state with antiferromagnetic\nordering localized at the edges, similar to the fully hydrogenated\ncounterparts. More important, edge oxidation is found to lower the onset\nelectric field required to induce half-metallic behavior and extend the overall\nfield range at which the systems remain half-metallic. Once the half-metallic\nstate is reached, further increase of the external electric field intensity\nproduces a rapid decrease in the spin magnetization up to a point where the\nmagnetization is quenched completely. Finally, we find that oxygen containing\nedge groups have a minor effect on the energy difference between the\nantiferromagnetic ground state and the above-lying ferromagnetic state.\n"

    "abstract": "  We give an operator theoretic approach to the constructions of\nmultiresolutions as they are used in a number of basis constructions with\nwavelets, and in Hilbert spaces on fractals. Our approach starts with the\nfollowing version of the classical Baumslag-Solitar relations $u t = t^2 u$\nwhere $t$ is a unitary operator in a Hilbert space $\\mathcal H$ and $u$ is an\nisometry in $\\mathcal H$. There are isometric dilations of this system into a\nbigger Hilbert space, relevant for wavelets. For a variety of carefully\nselected dilations, the ``bigger'' Hilbert space may be $L^2(\\br)$, and the\ndilated operators may be the unitary operators which define a dyadic wavelet\nmultiresolutions of $L^2(\\br)$ with the subspace $\\mathcal H$ serving as the\ncorresponding resolution subspace. That is, the initialized resolution which is\ngenerated by the wavelet scaling function(s). In the dilated Hilbert space, the\nBaumslag-Solitar relations then take the more familiar form $u t u^{-1}, = t^2$.\n  We offer an operator theoretic framework including the standard construction;\nand we show how the representations of certain discrete semidirect group\nproducts serve to classify the possibilities. For this we analyze and compare\nseveral types of unitary representations of these semidirect products: the\ninduced representations in Mackey's theory, the wavelet representations on\n$L^2(\\br)$, the irreducible representation on the dual, the finite dimensional\nrepresentations, and the the regular representation.\n"

The 610 MHz\nsource counts can be modelled by the same populations that explain the 1.4 GHz\nsource counts, assuming a spectral index of -0.7 for the starburst galaxies and\nthe steep spectrum AGN population. We find a similar dependence of luminosity\nevolution on redshift for the starburst galaxies at 610 MHz as is found at 1.4\nGHz (i.e. 'Q'= 2.45 (+0.3,-0.4)).\n"

We observed eleven of them with the Max-Planck Millimeter Bolometer Array\n(MAMBO-2) at the IRAM 30m-telescope at 250 GHz and all of them with the Very\nLarge Array (VLA) at 1.4 GHz. Four sources are detected by MAMBO-2 and six are\ndetected by the VLA at >=3 sigma level. These sources, together with another 6\npublished in previous papers,yield a submillimeter/millimeter and radio\nobserved SDSS quasar sample at z~6. We use this sample to investigate the\nfar-infrared (FIR) andradio properties of optically bright quasars in the early\nuniverse. We compare this sample to lower redshift samples of quasars observed\ninthe submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths ((sub)mm), and find that the\ndistribution of the FIR to B band optical luminosity ratio (L_FIR/L_B) is\nsimilar from z~2 to 6. We find a weak correlation between the FIR luminosity\n(L_FIR) and B band optical luminosity (L_B) byincluding the (sub)mm observed\nsamples at all redshifts. Some strong (sub)mm detections in the z~6 sample have\nradio-to-FIR ratios within the range defined by star forming galaxies, which\nsuggests possible co-eval star forming activity with the powerful AGN in these\nsources. We calculate the rest frame radio to optical ratios (R*_1.4=L_{v,\n1.4GHz},/L_{v, 4400A},) for all of the VLA observed sources in the z~6 quasar\nsample. Only one radio detection in this sample, J083643.85+005453.3, has\nR*_1.4~40 and can be considered radio loud. There are no strong radio sources\n(R*_1.4>=100) among these SDSS quasars at z~6.

High-resolution imaging allows the exploration of morphologies\nof clusters in other galaxies. Surface brightness profiles from new Hubble\nSpace Telescope observations of 34 globular clusters in M31 are presented,\ntogether with fits of several different structural models to each cluster. M31\nclusters appear to be adequately fit by standard King models, and do not\nobviously require alternate descriptions with relatively stronger halos, such\nas are needed to fit many GCs in other nearby galaxies. The derived structural\nparameters are combined with corrected versions of those measured in an earlier\nsurvey to construct a comprehensive catalog of structural and dynamical\nparameters for M31 GCs with a sample size similar to that for the Milky Way.\nClusters in M31, the Milky Way, Magellanic Clouds, Fornax dwarf spheroidal and\nNGC 5128 define a very tight fundamental plane with identical slopes. The\ncombined evidence for these widely different galaxies strongly reinforces the\nview that old globular clusters have near-universal structural properties\nregardless of host environment.\n"

    "title": "The Sensitivity of Hybrid Differential Stereoscopy for Spectral Imaging",
    "abstract": "  Stereoscopic spectral imaging is an observing technique that affords rapid\nacquisition of limited spectral information over an entire image plane\nsimultaneously. Light from a telescope is dispersed into multiple spectral\norders, which are imaged separately, and two or more of the dispersed images\nare combined using an analogy between the (x,y,\\lambda) spectral data space and\nconventional (x,y,z) three-space. Because no photons are deliberately destroyed\nduring image acquisition, the technique is much more photon-efficient in some\nobserving regimes than existing techniques such as scanned-filtergraph or\nscanned-slit spectral imaging. Hybrid differential stereoscopy, which uses a\ncombination of conventional cross-correlation stereoscopy and linear\napproximation theory to extract the central wavelength of a spectral line, has\nbeen used to produce solar Stokes-V (line-of-sight) magnetograms in the 617.34\nnm Fe I line, and more sophisticated inversion techniques are currently being\nused to derive Doppler and line separation data from EUV images of the solar\ncorona collected in the neighboring lines of He-II and Si-XI at 30.4 nm. In\nthis paper we develop an analytic a priori treatment of noise in the line shift\nsignal derived from hybrid differential stereoscopy. We use the analysis to\nestimate the noise level and measurement precision in a high resolution solar\nmagnetograph based on stereoscopic spectral imaging, compare those estimates to\na test observation made in 2003, and discuss implications for future\ninstruments.\n"

The lifts of\ngeometric objects on tangent bundles are performed for certain classes of\nd-connections and frame transforms when the Riemann tensor is parametrized by\nconstant matrix coefficients. For such configurations, the flows of\nnon-stretching curves and corresponding bi-Hamilton and solitonic hierarchies\nencode information about Ricci flow evolution, Einstein spaces and exact\nsolutions in gravity and geometric mechanics. The applied methods were\nelaborated formally in Finsler geometry and allows us to develop the formalism\nfor generalized Riemann-Finsler and Lagrange spaces.

We also construct the Penrose limits of the\nsolutions dual to the Coulomb branch along a certain set of geodesics and, for\nthe resulting PP--wave metrics, we examine the effect of beta-deformations on\nthe giant graviton states. We find that giant gravitons exist only up to a\ncritical value of the sigma-deformation parameter, are not degenerate in energy\nwith the point graviton, and remain perturbatively stable. Finally, we probe\nthe sigma-deformed multicenter solutions by examining the static heavy-quark\npotential by means of Wilson loops.

    "abstract": "  Van Marle et al. (2005) showed that circumstellar absorption lines in early\nType Ib/c supernova and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra may reveal the\nprogenitor evolution of the exploding Wolf-Rayet star. While the quoted paper\ndeals with Wolf-Rayet stars which evolved through a red supergiant stage, we\ninvestigate here the initially more massive Wolf-Rayet stars which are thought\nto evolve through a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage. We perform hydrodynamic\nsimulations of the evolution of the circumstellar medium around a 60 Msol star,\nfrom the main sequence through the LBV and Wolf-Rayet stages, up to core\ncollapse. We then compute the column density of the circumstellar matter as a\nfunction of radial velocity, time and angle. This allows a comparison with the\nnumber and blue-shifts, of absorption components in the spectra of LBVs,\nWolf-Rayet stars, Type Ib/c supernovae and gamma-ray burst afterglows. Our\nsimulation for the post-LBV stage shows the formation of various absorption\ncomponents, which are, however, rather short lived; they dissipate on time\nscales shorter than 50,000yr. As the LBV stage is thought to occur at the\nbeginning of core helium burning, the remaining Wolf-Rayet life time is\nexpected to be one order of magnitude larger. When interpreting the absorption\ncomponents in the afterglow spectrum of GRB-021004 as circumstellar, it can be\nconcluded that the progenitor of this source did most likely not evolve through\nan LBV stage. However, a close binary with late common-envelope phase (Case C)\nmay produce a circumstellar medium that closely resembles the LBV to Wolf-Rayet\nevolution, but with a much shorter Wolf-Rayet period.\n"

    "abstract": "  We investigate faint radio emission from low- to high-luminosity Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Their\nradio properties are inferred by co-adding large ensembles of radio image\ncut-outs from the FIRST survey, as almost all of the sources are individually\nundetected. We correlate the median radio flux densities against a range of\nother sample properties, including median values for redshift, [OIII]\nluminosity, emission line ratios, and the strength of the 4000A break. We\ndetect a strong trend for sources that are actively undergoing star-formation\nto have excess radio emission beyond the ~10^28 ergs/s/Hz level found for\nsources without any discernible star-formation. Furthermore, this additional\nradio emission correlates well with the strength of the 4000A break in the\noptical spectrum, and may be used to assess the age of the star-forming\ncomponent. We examine two subsamples, one containing the systems with emission\nline ratios most like star-forming systems, and one with the sources that have\ncharacteristic AGN ratios. This division also separates the mechanism\nresponsible for the radio emission (star-formation vs. AGN). For both cases we\nfind a strong, almost identical, correlation between [OIII] and radio\nluminosity, with the AGN sample extending toward lower, and the star-formation\nsample toward higher luminosities. A clearer separation between the two\nsubsamples is seen as function of the central velocity dispersion of the host\ngalaxy. For systems with similar redshifts and velocity dispersions, the\nstar-formation subsample is brighter than the AGN in the radio by an order of\nmagnitude. This underlines the notion that the radio emission in star-forming\nsystems can dominate the emission associated with the AGN.\n"

    "abstract": "  We have conducted an extensive wide-field imaging survey for Cepheid\nvariables in the Local Group irregular galaxy WLM. From data obtained on 101\nnights, we have discovered 60 Cepheids which include 14 of the 15 Cepheid\nvariables previously detected by Sandage and Carlson. Down to a period of 3\ndays, our Cepheid survey in WLM should be practically complete. Importantly, we\nhave found for the first time a long-period Cepheid (P=54.2 days) in this\ngalaxy, alleviating the puzzle that WLM with its many blue, massive stars does\nnot contain Cepheids with periods longer than about 10 days. Our data define\ntight period-luminosity relations in V, I and the reddening-free Wesenheit\nmagnitude ${\\rm W},_{\\rm I},$ which are all extremely well fit by the\ncorresponding slopes of the LMC Cepheid PL relation, suggesting no change of\nthe PL relation slope down to a Cepheid metal abundance of about -1.0 dex, in\nagreement with other recent studies. We derive a true distance modulus to WLM\nof 25.144 $\\pm$0.03 (r) $\\pm$0.07 (s) mag from our data, in good agreement with\nthe earlier 24.92 $\\pm$ 0.21 mag determination of Lee, Freedman and Madore\n(1993a) from Cepheid variables.

    "title": "Universal Features of Dimensional Reduction Schemes from General\n  Covariance Breaking",
    "abstract": "  Many features of dimensional reduction schemes are determined by the breaking\nof higher dimensional general covariance associated with the selection of a\nparticular subset of coordinates. By investigating residual covariance we\nintroduce lower dimensional tensors --generalizing to one side Kaluza-Klein\ngauge fields and to the other side extrinsic curvature and torsion of embedded\nspaces-- fully characterizing the geometry of dimensional reduction. We obtain\ngeneral formulas for the reduction of the main tensors and operators of\nRiemannian geometry. In particular, we provide what is probably the maximal\npossible generalization of Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci equations and various other\nstandard formulas in Kaluza-Klein and embedded spacetimes theories. After\ngeneral covariance breaking, part of the residual covariance is perceived by\neffective lower dimensional observers as an infinite dimensional gauge group.\nThis reduces to finite dimensions in Kaluza-Klein and other few remarkable\nbackgrounds, all characterized by the vanishing of appropriate lower\ndimensional tensors.\n"

    "abstract": "  We report the detection of the millisecond pulsar B1257+12 with the Chandra\nX-ray Observatory. In a 20 ks exposure we detected 25 photons from the pulsar,\nwith energies between 0.4 and 2.0 keV, corresponding to the flux F_X=(4.4+/-\n0.9)*10^{-15}, ergs s^{-1}, cm^{-2}, in this energy range. The X-ray spectrum can\nbe described by a power-law model with photon index Gamma = 2.8 and luminosity\nL_X \\approx 2.5*10^{29}, ergs s^{-1}, in the 0.3--8 keV band, for a plausible\ndistance of 500 pc and hydrogen column density N_H=3*10^{20}, cm^{-2},.\nAlternatively, the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody model with kT ~ 0.22\nkeV and projected emitting area ~2000 m^2. If the thermal X-rays are emitted\nfrom two symmetric polar caps, the bolometric luminosity of the two caps is 2\nL_bol ~ 3*10^{29}, ergs s^{-1},. We compared our results with the data on other\n30 millisecond pulsars observed in X-rays and found that the apparent X-ray\nefficiency of PSR B1257+12, L_X/Edot ~ 3*10^{-5}, for d=500 pc, is lower than\nthose of most of millisecond pulsars. This might be explained by an unfavorable\norientation of the X-ray pulsar beam if the radiation is magnetospheric, or by\nstrong asymmetry of polar caps if the radiation is thermal (e.g., one of the\npolar caps is much brighter than the other and remains invisible for most part\nof the pulsar period). Alternatively, it could be attributed to absorption of\nX-rays in circumpulsar matter, such as a flaring debris disk left over after\nformation of the planetary system around the pulsar.\n"

The current apparent\nexpansion velocity of the image size is only mildly relativistic, suggesting a\nnon-relativistic transition time of t_NR ~ 1 yr. A rebrightening, or at least a\nsignificant flattening in the flux decay, is expected within the next several\nyears as the counter-jet becomes visible (this has not yet been observed).

The\nlatter two components are often modeled as zero-pressure fluids. In our\nprevious work we have shown that to the second-order cosmological\nperturbations, the relativistic equations of the zero-pressure, irrotational,\nmulti-component fluids in a spatially near flat background effectively coincide\nwith the Newtonian equations. As the Newtonian equations only have quadratic\norder nonlinearity, it is practically interesting to derive the potential\nthird-order perturbation terms in general relativistic treatment which\ncorrespond to pure general relativistic corrections. Here, we present pure\ngeneral relativistic correction terms appearing in the third-order\nperturbations of the multi-component zero-pressure fluids. We show that, as in\na single component situation, the third-order correction terms are quite small\n(~ 5 x10^{-5}, smaller compared with the relativistic/Newtonian second-order\nterms) due to the weak level anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background\nradiation. Still, there do exist pure general relativistic correction terms in\nthird-order perturbations which could potentially become important in future\ndevelopment of precision cosmology. We include the cosmological constant in all\nour analyses.\n"

The two complementary problems are called MaxAgree and MinDisagree,\nrespectively, and have been studied on complete graphs, where every edge is\nlabeled, and general graphs, where some edge might not have been labeled.\nNatural edge-weighted versions of both problems have been studied as well. Let\nS-MaxAgree denote the weighted problem where all weights are taken from set S,\nwe show that S-MaxAgree with weights bounded by $O(|V|^{1/2-\\delta},)$\nessentially belongs to the same hardness class in the following sense: if there\nis a polynomial time algorithm that approximates S-MaxAgree within a factor of\n$\\lambda = O(\\log{|V|},)$ with high probability, then for any choice of S',\nS'-MaxAgree can be approximated in polynomial time within a factor of $(\\lambda\n+ \\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon > 0$ can be arbitrarily small, with high\nprobability.

In the present paper,\nthis parameterization is extended to a more general form, and a method for data\nanalysis (least squares) is discussed for the propose of determining the rate\nof contribution from the $(V+A)$ current. We find that there is a simple form\nin which the set of parameters is related primitively to the physical\nquantities. It is shown that the Michel parameters are one of the other sets\nthat are obtained from this simple form by rearranging one term. We derive the\ncondition to obtain the same information regarding unknown physical quantities\nin the case that the data are analyzed using these simple and rearranged forms\nseparately. We find that there is some possibility to get different results\nfrom these analyses, because the equivalent condition is very delicate and the\nQED radiative corrections should be treated carefully. We propose a consistent\nformula for data analysis. It is useful to compare the value obtained in the\nleast squares fit using the simple form with that obtained using the prediction\nof the standard model, because a large difference is not expected, especially\nin the case of the Majorana neutrino. Finally, we point out that the method we\nproposed to determine the type of neutrino in the previous paper is incorrect.\n"

    "title": "Prewavelet Solution to Poisson Equations",
    "abstract": "  Finite element method is one of powerful numerical methods to solve PDE.\nUsually, if a finite element solution to a Poisson equation based on a\ntriangulation of the underlying domain is not accurate enough, one will discard\nthe solution and then refine the triangulation uniformly and compute a new\nfinite element solution over the refined triangulation. It is wasteful to\ndiscard the original finite element solution. We propose a prewavelet method to\nsave the original solution by adding a prewavelet subsolution to obtain the\nrefined level finite element solution. To increase the accuracy of numerical\nsolution to Poisson equations, we can keep adding prewavelet subsolutions.\n  Our prewavelets are orthogonal in the $H^1$ norm and they are compactly\nsupported except for one globally supported basis function in a rectangular\ndomain. We have implemented these prewavelet basis functions in MATLAB and used\nthem for numerical solution of Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary\nconditions. Numerical simulation demonstrates that our prewavelet solution is\nmuch more efficient than the standard finite element method.\n"

We work out in detail the dynamics of\ninflaton fluctuations across the phase transition and the proper choices of\ninitial vacuum states.

In constraining this transitional effect by WMAP anisotropy\ndata, we use the WMAP best-fit scale-invariant $\\Lambda$CDM model with the\ndensity power spectrum replaced by the one found in this work.

We detect NH3(1,1) emission\ntoward all 21 regions and 24 GHz continuum emission toward 12 of the regions,\nincluding 6 with no reported 8 GHz continuum counterparts. In total, we find\nthe 21 regions contain 41 NH3(1,1) cores. We extract characteristic spectra for\nevery core at each of the NH3 transitions and present both integrated intensity\nmaps and channel maps for each region. The NH3(4,4)+(5,5) emission is always\nunresolved and found at the maser position indicating that the methanol masers\nare found at the warmest part of the core. We observe large asymmetries in the\nNH3(1,1) hyperfine line profiles and conclude this is due to a number of dense,\nsmall clumps within the beam. We derive properties of the ionised gas and find\nthe 24 GHz continuum sources not detected at 8 GHz are always coincident with\nboth NH3 and methanol masers in contrast to those detected at 8 + 24 GHz which\nare generally offset from the methanol masers. We investigate the possibility\nthat the former may be hyper-compact HII regions. Finally, we separate the\ncores into five groups, based on their association with NH3, methanol maser and\ncontinuum emission. From the different physical properties of the cores in the\ngroups, we discuss the possibility that these groups may represent cores at\ndifferent evolutionary stages of the massive star formation process.\n"

    "abstract": "  [ABRIDGED] We recently presented evidence of a connection between the\nbrightness profiles of nearby early-type galaxies and the properties of the AGN\nthey host. The radio loudness of the AGN appears to be univocally related to\nthe host's brightness profile: radio-loud nuclei are only hosted by ``core''\ngalaxies while radio-quiet AGN are only found in ``power-law'' galaxies. We\nextend our analysis here to a sample of 42 nearby (V < 7000 km/s) Seyfert\ngalaxies hosted by early-type galaxies. We used the available HST images to\nstudy their brightness profiles. Having excluded complex and highly nucleated\ngalaxies, in the remaining 16 objects the brightness profiles can be\nsuccessfully modeled with a Nuker law with a steep nuclear cusp characteristic\nof ``power-law'' galaxies (with logarithmic slope 0.51 - 1.07). This result is\nwhat is expected for these radio-quiet AGN based on our previous findings, thus\nextending the validity of the connection between brightness profile and radio\nloudness to AGN of a far higher luminosity. We explored the robustness of this\nresult against a different choice of the analytic form for the brightness\nprofiles, using a Sersic law. In no object could we find evidence of a central\nlight deficit with respect to a pure Sersic model, the defining feature of\n``core'' galaxies in this modeling framework. We conclude that, regardless of\nthe modeling strategy, the dichotomy of AGN radio loudness can be univocally\nrelated to the host's brightness profile. Our general results can be re-phrased\nas ``radio-loud nuclei are hosted by core galaxies, while radio-quiet AGN are\nfound in non-core galaxies''.\n"

    "abstract": "  The nonadiabatic Heisenberg model (NHM) proposed as an extension of the\nHeisenberg model makes a contribution to the eigenstate problem of\nsuperconductivity. The Hamiltonian H^n derived within this group-theoretical\nmodel has superconducting eigenstates if and only if the considered material\npossesses a narrow, roughly half-filled \"superconducting\" energy band of\nspecial symmetry in its band structure. This paper shows that the\nhigh-temperature superconductor YBa_2Cu_3O_7 possesses such a superconducting\nband. This new result together with previous observations about other\nsuperconductors and non-superconductors corroborates the theoretical evidence\nwithin the NHM that stable superconducting states are connected with\nsuperconducting bands. It is proposed that the type of superconductivity, i.e.,\nwhether the material is a conventional low-T_c or a high-T_c superconductor, is\ndetermined by the energetically lowest boson excitations that carry the crystal\nspin 1*hbar and are sufficiently stable to transport this crystal spin-angular\nmomentum through the crystal. This mechanism provides the electron-phonon\nmechanism that enters the BCS theory in conventional superconductors.\n"

    "abstract": "  The frequency distribution of DNA bases A, C, G, T exhibit fractal\nfluctuations ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature. The power spectra of\nfractal fluctuations exhibit inverse power law form signifying long-range\ncorrelations between local (small-scale) and global (large-scale)\nperturbations. The author has developed a general systems theory based on\nclassical statistical physics for fractal fluctuations which predicts that the\nprobability distribution of eddy amplitudes and the variance (square of eddy\namplitude)spectrum of fractal fluctuations follow the universal Boltzmann\ninverse power law expressed as a function of the golden mean. The model\npredicted distribution is very close to statistical normal distribution for\nfluctuations within two standard deviations from the mean and exhibits a fat\nlong tail. In this paper it is shown that DNA base CG frequency distribution in\nTakifugu rubripes (Puffer fish) Genome Release 4 exhibit universal inverse\npower law form consistent with model prediction. The observed long-range\ncorrelations in the DNA bases implies that the non-coding 'junk' or 'selfish'\nDNA which appear to be redundant, may also contribute to the efficient\nfunctioning of the protein coding DNA, a result supported by recent studies.\n"

    "abstract": "  The cross-correlations between price fluctuations of 201 frequently traded\nstocks in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are analyzed in this\npaper. We use daily closing prices for the period 1996-2006, which coincides\nwith the period of rapid transformation of the market following liberalization.\nThe eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\\mathbf{C},$, of\nNSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York\nStock Exchange (NYSE): the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds\nexpected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time\nseries. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest\nis identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that\noccur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with\nspecific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the\nIndian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie\nmuch closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack\nof distinct sector identity in the market, with the movement of stocks\ndominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit\nconstruction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the\nminimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using\nan improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode\nand random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed\nmarkets, the relative absence of clusters of co-moving stocks that belong to\nthe same business sector. This is consistent with the general belief that\nemerging markets tend to be more correlated than developed markets.\n"

    "abstract": "  Coarsening kinetics is usually described using a linear gradient\napproximation for the underlying interface migration (IM) rates, wherein the\nmigration fluxes at the interfaces vary linearly with the driving force. Recent\nexperimental studies have shown that coarsening of nanocrystalline interface\nmicrostructures is unexpectedly stable compared to conventional parabolic\ncoarsening kinetics. Here, we show that during early stage coarsening of these\nmicrostructures, IM rates can develop a non-linear dependence on the driving\nforce, the mean interface curvature. We derive the modified mean field law for\ncoarsening kinetics. Molecular dynamics simulations of individual grain\nboundaries reveal a sub-linear curvature dependence of IM rates, suggesting an\nintrinsic origin for the slow coarsening kinetics observed in polycrystalline\nmetals.\n"

For the first time, models are\nalso provided with modified surface abundances of C, N and O, as a step towards\naccounting for the changes known to occur due to convective dredge-up (and to\nbe enhanced in the case of rotation). The aims are (i) to assess how well\ncurrent models reproduce observed spectra, (ii) to quantify the effects of the\nabundance changes on the spectra, and (iii) to determine how these changes\naffect estimates of fundamental stellar parameters.\n  Observed giant star spectra can be fitted very well at solar metallicity down\nto about 3400K. Modified surface abundances are preferred in only a minority of\ncases for luminosity class II, possibly indicating mixing in excess of standard\nfirst dredge-up.\n  Supergiant stars show a larger variety of near-IR spectra, and good fits are\ncurrently obtained for about one third of the observations only. Modified\nsurface abundances help reproducing strong CN bands, but do not suffice to\nresolve all the difficulties. The effect of the abundance changes on the\nestimated Teff depends on the wavelength range of observation and can amount\nseveral 100K. Reasons for the remaining discrepancies are discussed.\n"

    "abstract": "  In this paper we continue to pursue a goal of finding an effective theory for\nhigh energy interaction in QCD based on the colour dipole approach, for which\nthe BFKL Pomeron Calculus gives a low energy limit. The key problem, that we\ntry to solve in this paper is the probabilistic interpretation of the BFKL\nPomeron Calculus in terms of the colourless dipoles and their interactions. We\ndemonstrate that the BFKL Pomeron Calculus has two equivalent descriptions :\n(i) one is the generating functional which gives a clear probabilistic\ninterpretation of the processes of high energy scattering and also provides a\nHamiltonian-like description of the system of interacting dipoles; (ii) the\nsecond is the Langevin equation with a specific noise term which is rather\ncomplicated. We found that at high energies this Langevin equation can be\nreduced to the Langevin equation for directed percolation in the momentum space\nif the impact parameter is large, namely, $b>> 1/k$, where $k$ is the\ntransverse momentum of a dipole. Unfortunately, this simplified form of\nLangevin equation is not applicable for summation of Pomeron loops, where one\nintegrates over all possible values of impact parameter. We show that the BFKL\nPomeron calculus with two vertices (splitting $P\\to P+P$ and merging $P+P\\to P$\nof Pomerons) can be interpreted as a system of colourless dipoles with two\nprocesses: the decay of one dipole into two and the merging of two dipoles into\none dipole. However, a number of assumptions we have to make on the way to\nsimplify the noise term in the Langevin equation and/or to apply the\nprobabilistic interpretation, therefore, we can consider both of these\napproaches in the present form only as the QCD motivated models.\n"

Their X-ray emission is of non thermal origin and due to\nInverse Compton scattering of the microwave background photons by relativistic\nelectrons in the lobes, as previously found. In both lobes, the equipartition\nmagnetic field (Beq) is bigger than the Inverse Compton value (Bic), calculated\nfrom the radio and X-ray flux ratio. The Beq/Bic ratio never gets below 2, in\nspite of the large number of reasonable assumptions tested to calculate Beq,\nsuggesting a lobe energetic dominated by particles. The X-ray data quality is\ngood enough to allow a spatially resolved analysis. Our study shows that Bic\nvaries through the lobes. It appears to increase behind the hot spots. On the\ncontrary, a rather uniform distribution of the particles is observed. As a\nconsequence, the radio flux density variation along the lobes appears to be\nmainly driven by magnetic field changes.\n"

The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones\ndid not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting\nthat growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observed\ndistributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic model\nassuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successive\ncell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,\nwe have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average number\nof mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observed\ndistributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria were\nrendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonal\ngrowth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cell\npopulation is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. At\nleast part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number of\nmitochondria.\n"

    "abstract": "  The X-ray transient XMMU J174716.1-281048 was serendipitously discovered with\nXMM-Newton in 2003. It lies about 0.9 degrees off the Galactic Centre and its\nspectrum shows a high absorption (~8 x 10E22 cm^(-2)). Previous X-ray\nobservations of the source field performed in 2000 and 2001 did not detect the\nsource, indicative of a quiescent emission at least two orders of magnitude\nfainter. The low luminosity during the outburst (~5 x 10E34 erg/s at 8 kpc)\nindicates that the source is a member of the ``very faint X-ray transients''\nclass. On 2005 March 22nd the INTEGRAL satellite caught a possible type-I X-ray\nburst from the new INTEGRAL source IGR J17464-2811, classified as fast X-ray\ntransient. This source was soon found to be positionally coincident, within the\nuncertainties, with XMMU J174716.1-281048. Here we report data analysis of the\nX-ray burst observed with the IBIS and JEM-X telescopes and confirm the type-I\nburst nature. We also re-analysed XMM-Newton and Chandra archival observations\nof the source field. We discuss the implications of these new findings,\nparticularly related to the source distance as well as the source\nclassification.\n"

Combined with very deep\nSubaru optical photometry, the depth (K_AB = 22.5) and area (0.62 deg^2) of the\nUDS EDR allows us to investigate optical/near-IR selection using a large sample\nof over 30,000 objects. By using the B-z, z-K colour-colour diagram (the BzK\ntechnique) we identify over 7500 candidate galaxies at z > 1.4, which can be\nfurther separated into passive and starforming systems (pBzK and sBzK\nrespectively). Our unique sample allows us to identify a new feature not\npreviously seen in BzK diagrams, consistent with the passively evolving track\nof early type galaxies at z < 1.4. We also compare the BzK technique with the\nR-K colour selection of Extremely Red Objects (EROs) and the J-K selection of\nDistant Red Galaxies (DRGs), and quantify the overlap between these\npopulations. We find that the majority of DRGs, at these relatively bright\nmagnitudes are also EROs. Since previous studies have found that DRGs at these\nmagnitudes have redshifts of z ~ 1 we determine that these DRG/ERO galaxies\nhave SEDs consistent with being dusty star-forming galaxies or AGN at z < 2.\nFinally we observe a flattening in the number counts of pBzK galaxies, similar\nto other studies, which may indicate that we are sampling the luminosity\nfunction of passive z > 1 galaxies over a narrow redshift range.\n"

    "abstract": "  Based on our sample of 10095 galaxies with bulge-disc decompositions we\nderive the empirical B-band internal attenuation--inclination relation for\ngalaxy discs and their associated central bulges. Our results agree well with\nthe independently derived dust models of Tuffs et al., leading to a direct\nconstraint on the mean opacity of spiral discs of Tau_B^f = 3.8 +/- 0.7\n(central face-on B-band opacity). Depending on inclination, the B-band\nattenuation correction varies from 0.2 -- 1.1 mag for discs and from 0.8 -- 2.6\nmag for bulges. We find that, overall, 37 per cent of all B-band photons\nproduced in discs in the nearby universe are absorbed by dust, a figure that\nrises to 71 per cent for bulge photons. The severity of internal dust\nextinction is such that one must incorporate internal dust corrections in all\noptical studies of large galaxy samples. This is particularly pertinent for\noptical HST comparative evolutionary studies as the dust properties will also\nbe evolving. We use the new results to revise our recent estimates of the\nspheroid and disc luminosity functions. From our best fitting dust models we\nderive a redshift zero cosmic dust density of rho_{dust}, ~ (5.3 +/- 1.7) x\n10^5, h M_{odot}, Mpc^-3. This implies that (0.0083 +/- 0.0027), h per cent of\nthe baryons in the Universe are in the form of dust and (11.9 +/- 1.7), h per\ncent (Salpeter-`lite' IMF) are in the form of stars (~58 per cent reside in\ngalaxy discs, ~10 per cent in red elliptical galaxies, ~29 per cent in\nclassical galaxy bulges and the remainder in low luminosity blue spheroid\nsystems/components).

We find the range of admitted current density distributions\nunder the requirement that the potential drop in the polar cap is less than the\nvacuum potential drop. We show that the current density distribution could\ndeviate significantly from the ``classical'' Michel distribution and could be\nmade almost constant over the polar cap even when the potential drop in the\naccelerating zone is of the order of 10 per cents of the vacuum potential drop.\nWe argue that differential rotation of the open magnetic field lines could play\nan important role in adjusting between the magnetosphere and the polar cap\ncascade zone and could affect the value of pulsar breaking index.\n"

To\ninvestigate such galaxy-IGM interplay we have generated synthetic optical\nabsorption line spectra piercing the volume surrounding a starbursting analog\nof a Lyman Break Galaxy selected in a $z \\approx 3$ output from a SPH\nsimulation, including a detailed treatment of mechanical feedback from winds.\nDistributions for several observable species (HI, CIII, CIV, SiII, SiIII, SiIV,\nOVI, OVII, and OVIII) have been derived by post-processing the simulation\noutputs. The hot wind material is characterized by the presence of\nhigh-ionization species such as OVI, OVII, and OVIII (the latter two observable\nonly in X-ray bands); the colder ($T<10^{5.5},$ K) infalling streams can be\ninstead identified by the combined presence of SiII, SiIII, and CIII optical\nabsorption together with OVI that surrounds the cooler gas clumps. However,\nboth line profile and Pixel Optical Depth analysis of the synthetic spectra\nshow that the intergalactic filament in which the wind-blowing galaxy is\nembedded produces absorption signatures that closely mimic those of the wind\nenvironment. We conclude that may be difficult to clearly identify wind-blowing\ngalaxies and their complex gaseous environment at high redshift in optical QSO\nabsorption-line spectra based solely on the observed ion absorption patterns.\n"

A 27, 143 (2006)) has been applied in studying\ncenter-of-mass motion effects on the nucleon density and momentum distributions\nin nuclei. We are focused upon effects due to the center-of-mass and\nshort-range nucleon correlations embedded in translationally invariant\nground-state wavefunctions. The latter are constructed in the so-called fixed\ncenter-of-mass approximation, starting with a Slater determinant wave function\nmodified by some correlator (e.g., after Jastrow or Villars). It is shown how\none can simplify evaluation of the corresponding expectation values that\ndetermine the distributions. The analytic expressions derived here involve the\nown \"Tassie-Barker\" factors for each distribution. As an illustration,\nnumerical calculations have been carried out for the nucleus ^{4},He with the\nSlater determinant to describe the nucleon (1s)^4 configuration composed of\nsingle-particle orbitals which differ from harmonic oscillator ones at small\ndistances. Such orbitals simulate somewhat short-range repulsion between\nnucleons. Special attention is paid to a simultaneous shrinking of the\ncenter--of--mass corrected density and momentum distributions compared to the\npurely (1s)^4 shell nontranslationally invariant ones.\n"

With additional\nsaturation broadening a spectral linewidth comparable to the thermal energy of\nthe atoms in the heated gas cell is achieved. An intensity-dependent blue\nasymmetry of the spectra is observed, which becomes increasingly pronounced\nwhen extrapolating to infinitely high light intensity.

    "abstract": "  The aim of this survey is to give an overview on the geometry of Einstein\nmaximal globally hyperbolic 2+1 spacetimes of arbitrary curvature, conatining a\ncomplete Cauchy surface of finite type. In particular a specialization to the\nfinite type case of the canonicla Wick rotation-rescaling theory, previously\ndeveloped by the authors, is provided. This includes, for arbitrary curvatures,\nparameterizations in terms of suitable measured geodesic laminations on open\nhyperbolic surfaces of finite type. The same geometric objects also\nparameterize complex projective structures on the surfaces. The coincidence of\nsuch parameter space is explained by means of geometric correlations between\nspacetimes of different curvatures and projective surfaces realized via\ncanonical WR-rescaling along the cosmological times. We also specialize on AdS\ncase mostly referring to recent results achieved by other authors. In\nparticular we describe maximal causal extensions of AdS globally hyperbolic\nspacetimes and an AdS approach to the theory of earthquakes for hyperbolic\nsurfaces of finite type. A general earthquake theorem is proved for the so\ncalled enhanced Teichmuller space. The case of spacetimes with conical timelike\nsingularities is also treated.\n"

Here, we discuss ways of\ncontrollable manipulation of photonic molecule supermodes, which improve or add\nnew functionalities to microcavity-based optical components. We present several\noptimally-tuned photonic molecule designs for lowering thresholds of\nsemiconductor microlasers, producing directional light emission, enhancing\nsensitivity of microcavity-based bio(chemical)sensors, and optimizing\nelectromagnetic energy transfer around bends of coupled-cavity waveguides.\nPhotonic molecules composed of identical microcavities as well as of\nmicrocavities with various degrees of size or material detuning are discussed.\nMicrowave experiments on scaled photonic molecule structures are currently\nunder way to confirm our theoretical predictions.\n"

When the\nsegments are parallel and superposed, the total string tension is larger and\nagrees with the Casimir Scaling measured by Bali.

    "abstract": "  We describe the methodology and compute the illumination of geometrically\nthin accretion disks around black holes of arbitrary spin parameter $a$ exposed\nto the radiation of a point-like, isotropic source at arbitrary height above\nthe disk on its symmetry axis. We then provide analytic fitting formulae for\nthe illumination as a function of the source height $h$ and the black hole\nangular momentum $a$. We find that for a source on the disk symmetry axis and\n$h/M > 3$, the main effect of the parameter $a$ is allowing the disk to extend\nto smaller radii (approaching $r/M \\to 1$ as $a/M \\to 1$) and thus allow the\nillumination of regions of much higher rotational velocity and redshift. We\nalso compute the illumination profiles for anisotropic emission associated with\nthe motion of the source relative to the accretion disk and present the\nfractions of photons absorbed by the black hole, intercepted by the disk or\nescaping to infinity for both isotropic and anisotropic emission for $a/M=0$\nand $a/M=0.99$. As the anisotropy (of a source approaching the disk) increases\nthe illumination profile reduces (approximately) to a single power-law, whose\nindex, $q$, because of absorption of the beamed photons by the black hole,\nsaturates to a value no higher than $q \\gtrsim 3$. Finally, we compute the\nfluorescence Fe line profiles associated with the specific illumination and\ncompare them among various cases.\n"

One proposed solution to this atmospheric\neffect is to observe simultaneously at two separate frequency bands of 230 and\n690 GHz. Although the phase fluctuations have a smaller magnitude at the lower\nfrequency, they can be measured more accurately and on shorter timescales due\nto the greater sensitivity of the array to celestial point source calibrators\nat this frequency. In theory, we can measure the atmospheric phase fluctuations\nin the 230 GHz band, scale them appropriately with frequency, and apply them to\nthe data in 690 band during the post-observation calibration process. The\nultimate limit to this atmospheric phase calibration scheme will be set by the\ninstrumental phase stability of the IF and LO systems. We describe the\nmethodology and initial results of the phase stability characterization of the\nIF and LO systems.\n"

The electromagnetic interaction regains\nits long-range character at distances larger than the Compton length, the\npotential decreasing across the magnetic field faster than along.

The absolute\nposition of both emission distributions were recovered using the phase\nreferencing technique, and accurately registered in HST optical images. H$_2$O\nmaser clumps are found to be distributed in two areas of 20 mas in size\nspatially displaced by $\\sim$60 milli-arcseconds along an axis oriented nearly\nnorth-south. SiO masers are tentatively found to be placed between the two\nH$_2$O maser emitting regions, probably indicating the position of the Mira\ncomponent of the system. The SiO maser emission traces an inner equatorial\ncomponent with a diameter of 12 AU, probably a disk rotating around the M-type\nstar. Outwards, we detect in the H$_2$O data a pair of polar caps, separated by\n80 AU. We believe that the inner regions of the nebula probably have been\naltered by the presence of the companion, leading to an equator-to-pole density\ncontrast that may explain the lack of H$_2$O masers and strong SiO maser\nemission in the denser, equatorial regions.\n"

Our analysis is motivated\nby the Laplace-Bernstein-Von Mises central limit theorem, which states that in\nlarge samples the posterior or quasi-posterior approaches a normal density.\nUsing the conditions required for the central limit theorem to hold, we\nestablish polynomial bounds on the computational complexity of general\nMetropolis random walks methods in large samples. Our analysis covers cases\nwhere the underlying log-likelihood or extremum criterion function is possibly\nnon-concave, discontinuous, and with increasing parameter dimension. However,\nthe central limit theorem restricts the deviations from continuity and\nlog-concavity of the log-likelihood or extremum criterion function in a very\nspecific manner.\n  Under minimal assumptions required for the central limit theorem to hold\nunder the increasing parameter dimension, we show that the Metropolis algorithm\nis theoretically efficient even for the canonical Gaussian walk which is\nstudied in detail. Specifically, we show that the running time of the algorithm\nin large samples is bounded in probability by a polynomial in the parameter\ndimension $d$, and, in particular, is of stochastic order $d^2$ in the leading\ncases after the burn-in period. We then give applications to exponential\nfamilies, curved exponential families, and Z-estimation of increasing\ndimension.\n"

    "abstract": "  We have determined the physical ground state properties of the compounds\nCeRuPO and CeOsPO by means of magnetic susceptibility chi(T), specific heat\nC(T), electrical resistivity rho(T), and thermopower S(T) measurements. chi(T)\nreveals a trivalent 4f1 cerium state in both compounds. For CeRuPO a pronounced\ndecrease of rho(T) below 50K indicates the onset of coherent Kondo scattering\nwhich is confirmed by enhanced S(T). The temperature and magnetic field\ndependence of chi(T) and C(T) evidence ferromagnetic (FM) order at TC=15K.\nThus, CeRuPO seems to be one of the rare example of a FM Kondo lattice. In\ncontrast, CeOsPO shows antiferromagnetic order at TN=4.4K despite only minor\nchanges in lattice parameters and electronic configuration. Additional 31P NMR\nresults support these scenarios. LSDA+U calculations evidence a quasi two\ndimensional electronic band structure, reflecting a strong covalent bonding\nwithin the CeO and RuP layers and a weak ionic like bonding between the layers.\n"

    "abstract": "  The description of the statistical properties of dust emission gives\nimportant constraints on the physics of the interstellar medium but it is also\na useful way to estimate the contamination of diffuse interstellar emission in\nthe cases where it is considered a nuisance. The main goals of this analysis of\nthe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of 100 micron dust emission are\n1) to estimate the power spectrum of interstellar matter density in three\ndimensions, 2) to review and extend previous estimates of the cirrus noise due\nto dust emission and 3) to produce simulated dust emission maps that reproduce\nthe observed statistical properties. The main results are the following. 1) The\ncirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previously\noverestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where\n<I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is in\naccordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at a\ngiven angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasing\namplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dust\nemission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on average\nbut shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions have\nsystematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness and\nkurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strong\nnon-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron power\nspectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a function\nof wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modification\nof Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproduce\nthe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.\n"

    "abstract": "  (Abridged) Luminous Compact Galaxies (LCGs) (M_B < -20, R_{1/2}, < 4.5kpc and\nEW_{0},(OII) >15\\AA) constitute one of the most rapidly evolving galaxy\npopulations over the last ~8 Gyr history of the universe. Due to their\ninherently compact sizes, any detailed quantitative analysis of their\nmorphologies has proved to be difficult in the past. In this work we use the\nhigh angular resolution imaging data, from the HST/ACS GOODS survey, to study\nthe quantitative morphology of a complete sample of LCGs in the redshift range\n0.5 < z < 1.2. We have derived structural parameters for a representative\nsample of 39 LCGs selected from the GOODS-S field, using full 2-dimensional\nsurface brightness profile fitting of the galaxy images in each of the four\nfilters available. B-z color maps are used as an aid in the morphological\nclassification. We then use the rest frame B band bulge flux fraction (B/T) to\ndetermine the morphological class of the galaxies. Mergers were essentially\nidentified visually by the presence of multiple maxima of comparable intensity\nin the rest frame B band images, aided by the color maps to distinguish them\nfrom HII regions. We derive the following morphological mix for our sample of\nintermediate redshift LCGs: Mergers: ~36%, Disk dominated: ~22%, S0: ~20%,\nEarly types: ~7%, Irr/tadpole: ~15%. We establish that our sample LCGs are\nintermediate mass objects with a median stellar mass of Log(M/M_{\\odot},)=10.32.\nWe also derive dust enshrouded SFR values ranging from a few to ~65\n$M_{\\odot},$/year using Spitzer 24$\\mu m$ data. We estimate a factor ~11 fall in\nthe comoving number density of blue LCGs from redshifts 0.5 < z < 1.2 to the\ncurrent epoch. We finally discuss the evolutionary scenario of these LCGs which\nmight give us some clues regarding their descendants in the local universe.\n"

    "abstract": "  We report the results of spectroscopic mapping observations carried out\ntoward small (1 x 1 arcmin) regions within the supernova remnants W44, W28,\nIC443, and 3C391 using the Infrared Spectrograph of the Spitzer Space\nTelescope. These observations, covering the 5.2 - 37 micron spectral region,\nhave led to the detection of a total of 15 fine structure transitions of Ne+,\nNe++, Si+, P+, S, S++, Cl+, Fe+, and Fe++; the S(0) - S(7) pure rotational\nlines of molecular hydrogen; and the R(3) and R(4) transitions of hydrogen\ndeuteride. In addition to these 25 spectral lines, the 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and\n12.6 micron PAH emission bands were also observed. Most of the detected line\ntransitions have proven strong enough to map in several sources, providing a\ncomprehensive picture of the relative distribution of the various line\nemissions observable in the Spitzer/IRS bandpass. A principal component\nanalysis of the spectral line maps reveals that the observed emission lines\nfall into five distinct groups, each of which may exhibit a distinct spatial\ndistribution: (1) lines of S and H2 (J > 2); (2) the H2 S(0) line; (3) lines of\nions with appearance potentials less than 13.6 eV; (4) lines of ions with\nappearance potentials greater than 13.6 eV, not including S++; (5) lines of\nS++. Lines of group (1) likely originate in molecular material subject to a\nslow, nondissociative shock that is driven by the overpressure within the\nsupernova remnant, and lines in groups (3) - (5) are associated primarily with\ndissociative shock fronts with a range of (larger) shock velocities. The H2\nS(0) line shows a low-density diffuse emission component, and - in some sources\n- a shock-excited component.\n"

    "abstract": "  After the work of Gladman et al. (1998), it is now assessed that many\nirregular satellites are orbiting around Uranus. Despite many studies have been\nperformed in past years, very few is know for the light-curves of these objects\nand inconsistencies are present between colours derived by different authors.\nThis situation motivated our effort to improve both the knowledge of colours\nand light curves. We present and discuss time series observations of Sycorax,\nProspero, Stephano, Setebos and Trinculo, five faint irregular satellites of\nUranus, carried out at VLT, ESO Paranal (Chile) in the nights between 29 and 30\nJuly, 2005 and 25 and 30 November, 2005. We derive light curves for Sycorax and\nProspero and colours for all of these these bodies. For Sycorax we obtain\ncolours B-V =0.839 +/- 0.014, V-R = 0.531 +/- 0.005 and a light curve which is\nsuggestive of a periodical variation with period about 3.6 hours and amplitude\nabout 0.067 +/- 0.004 mag. The periods and colours we derive for Sycorax are in\nagreement with our previous determination in 1999 using NTT. We derive also a\nlight-curve for Prospero which suggests an amplitude of about 0.2 mag and a\nperiodicity of about 4 hours. However, the sparseness of our data, prevents a\nmore precise characterization of the light-curves, and we can not determine\nwether they are one-peaked or two-peaked. Hence, these periods and amplitudes\nhave to be considered preliminary estimates. As for Setebos, Stephano and\nTrinculo the present data do not allow to derive any unambiguous periodicity,\ndespite Setebos displays a significant variability with amplitude about as\nlarge as that of Prospero. Colours for Prospero, Setebos, Stephano and Trinculo\nare in marginal agreement with the literature.\n"

This chapter presents analysis of experimental data which allow one\nto draw a conclusion about components and the structure of a potential\nroom-temperature superconductor. The two essential components of a room\ntemperature superconductor are large organic molecules (polymers, tissues) and\natoms/molecules which are magnetic in the intercalated state. This conclusion\nis fully based on experimental facts known today, and does not require any\nassumptions about the mechanism of room-temperature superconductivity. This,\nhowever, does not mean that to synthesize a room-temperature superconductor is\nan easy task.\n"

    "title": "Selection effects shaping the Gamma Ray Burst redshift distributions",
    "abstract": "  Long Gamma Ray Bursts hold the promise of probing star-formation and metal\nenrichment up to very high redshifts. The present GRB samples with redshift\ndetermination are largely incomplete and therefore a careful analysis of\nselection effects is mandatory before any conclusion can be drawn from the\nobserved GRB redshift distribution. We study and compare three well defined\nsamples of long GRBs detected by Swift, HETE2 and BeppoSAX. We find that Swift\nGRBs are slighly fainter and harder than BeppoSAX and HETE2 GRBs, as expected\ndue to the higher energy range in which Swift GRBs are detected and localized,\ncompared to BeppoSAX and HETE2. Gas and dust obscuration plays a role in\nshaping the GRB samples and the present samples of GRBs with redshift. We argue\nthat the majority of the bright Swift GRBs without redshift might actually be\nz<~2 events therefore the present Swift GRB sample with redshift is biased\nagainst low-z GRBs. On the other hand, the detection of bright UV rest-frame\nafterglows from high-z GRBs, and even from those with large X-ray obscuration,\nimplies a dust amount lower than in nearby GRBs,and/or a different dust\ncomposition. If this is the case, the Swift sample of GRBs with redshifts is\nprobably a fair sample of the real high-z GRB population. The absence of high-z\nGRBs in the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples of GRBs with redshifts is probably due\nto the fact at the time of BeppoSAX and HETE2 follow-up faint afterglows of\nhigh redshift GRBs will have weaken below the spectroscopic capabilities of\neven 10m class telescopes. The redshift distribution of a subsample of Swift\nGRBs with distributions of peak-fluxes, X-ray obscuration and optical magnitude\nat a fixed observing time similar to those of the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples,\nis roughly consistent with BeppoSAX+HETE2 redshift distribution.\n"

    "abstract": "  Chargaff's second parity rule holds empirically for most types of DNA that\nalong single strands of DNA the base contents are equal for complimentary\nbases, A = T, G = C. A Markov chain model is constructed to track the evolution\nof any single base position along single strands of genomes whose organisms are\nequipped with replication mismatch repair. Under the key assumptions that\nmismatch error rates primarily depend the number of hydrogen bonds of\nnucleotides and that the mismatch repairing process itself makes strand\nrecognition error, the model shows that the steady state probabilities for any\nbase position to take on one of the 4 nucleotide bases are equal for\ncomplimentary bases. As a result, Chargaff's second parity rule is the\nmanifestation of the Law of Large Number acting on the steady state\nprobabilities. More importantly, because the model pinpoints mismatch repair as\na basis of the rule, it is suitable for experimental verification.\n"

    "abstract": "  Accretion-powered X-ray pulsars are among the most luminous X-ray sources in\nthe Galaxy. However, despite decades of theoretical and observational work\nsince their discovery, no satisfactory model for the formation of the observed\nX-ray spectra has emerged. In this paper, we report on a self-consistent\ncalculation of the spectrum emerging from a pulsar accretion column that\nincludes an explicit treatment of the bulk and thermal Comptonization occurring\nin the radiation-dominated shocks that form in the accretion flows. Using a\nrigorous eigenfunction expansion method, we obtain a closed-form expression for\nthe Green's function describing the upscattering of monochromatic radiation\ninjected into the column. The Green's function is convolved with\nbremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and blackbody source terms to calculate the emergent\nphoton spectrum. We show that energization of photons in the shock naturally\nproduces an X-ray spectrum with a relatively flat continuum and a high-energy\nexponential cutoff. Finally, we demonstrate that our model yields good\nagreement with the spectra of the bright pulsar Her X-1 and the low luminosity\npulsar X Per.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present the stellar calibrator sample and the conversion from instrumental\nto physical units for the 24 micron channel of the Multiband Imaging Photometer\nfor Spitzer (MIPS). The primary calibrators are A stars, and the calibration\nfactor based on those stars is 4.54*10^{-2}, MJy sr^{-1}, (DN/s)^{-1},, with a\nnominal uncertainty of 2%. We discuss the data-reduction procedures required to\nattain this accuracy; without these procdures, the calibration factor obtained\nusing the automated pipeline at the Spitzer Science Center is 1.6% +/- 0.6%\nlower. We extend this work to predict 24 micron flux densities for a sample of\n238 stars which covers a larger range of flux densities and spectral types. We\npresent a total of 348 measurements of 141 stars at 24 micron. This sample\ncovers a factor of ~460 in 24 micron flux density, from 8.6 mJy up to 4.0 Jy.\nWe show that the calibration is linear over that range with respect to target\nflux and background level. The calibration is based on observations made using\n3-second exposures; a preliminary analysis shows that the calibration factor\nmay be 1% and 2% lower for 10- and 30-second exposures, respectively. We also\ndemonstrate that the calibration is very stable: over the course of the\nmission, repeated measurements of our routine calibrator, HD 159330, show a\nroot-mean-square scatter of only 0.4%. Finally, we show that the point spread\nfunction (PSF) is well measured and allows us to calibrate extended sources\naccurately; Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) and MIPS measurements of a\nsample of nearby galaxies are identical within the uncertainties.\n"

    "abstract": "  The absolute calibration and characterization of the Multiband Imaging\nPhotometer for Spitzer (MIPS) 70 micron coarse- and fine-scale imaging modes\nare presented based on over 2.5 years of observations. Accurate photometry\n(especially for faint sources) requires two simple processing steps beyond the\nstandard data reduction to remove long-term detector transients. Point spread\nfunction (PSF) fitting photometry is found to give more accurate flux densities\nthan aperture photometry. Based on the PSF fitting photometry, the calibration\nfactor shows no strong trend with flux density, background, spectral type,\nexposure time, or time since anneals. The coarse-scale calibration sample\nincludes observations of stars with flux densities from 22 mJy to 17 Jy, on\nbackgrounds from 4 to 26 MJy sr^-1, and with spectral types from B to M. The\ncoarse-scale calibration is 702 +/- 35 MJy sr^-1 MIPS70^-1 (5% uncertainty) and\nis based on measurements of 66 stars. The instrumental units of the MIPS 70\nmicron coarse- and fine-scale imaging modes are called MIPS70 and MIPS70F,\nrespectively. The photometric repeatability is calculated to be 4.5% from two\nstars measured during every MIPS campaign and includes variations on all time\nscales probed. The preliminary fine-scale calibration factor is 2894 +/- 294\nMJy sr^-1 MIPS70F^-1 (10% uncertainty) based on 10 stars. The uncertainty in\nthe coarse- and fine-scale calibration factors are dominated by the 4.5%\nphotometric repeatability and the small sample size, respectively. The 5-sigma,\n500 s sensitivity of the coarse-scale observations is 6-8 mJy. This work shows\nthat the MIPS 70 micron array produces accurate, well calibrated photometry and\nvalidates the MIPS 70 micron operating strategy, especially the use of frequent\nstimulator flashes to track the changing responsivities of the Ge:Ga detectors.\n"

Simulating the model in the computer,\nfaithfully reproduces the known sequence of regulatory activity patterns along\nthe cell cycle of the living cell. Contrary to existing differential equation\nmodels, no parameters enter the model except the structure of the regulatory\ncircuitry. The dynamical properties of the model indicate that the biological\ndynamical sequence is robustly implemented in the regulatory network, with the\nbiological stationary state G1 corresponding to the dominant attractor in state\nspace, and with the biological regulatory sequence being a strongly attractive\ntrajectory. Comparing the fission yeast cell-cycle model to a similar model of\nthe corresponding network in S. cerevisiae, a remarkable difference in\ncircuitry, as well as dynamics is observed. While the latter operates in a\nstrongly damped mode, driven by external excitation, the S. pombe network\nrepresents an auto-excited system with external damping.\n"

A new locally-constrained\ndensity-functional theory approach gave access to the corresponding\npotential-energy surface (PES) seen by such an impinging spin-triplet molecule\nand indicated barriers to dissociation which reduce the sticking probability.\nHere, we further substantiate this non-adiabatic picture by providing a\ndetailed account of the employed approach. Building on the previous work, we\nfocus in particular on inaccuracies in present-day exchange-correlation\nfunctionals. Our analysis shows that small quantitative differences in the\nspin-triplet constrained PES obtained with different gradient-corrected\nfunctionals have a noticeable effect on the lowest kinetic energy part of the\nresulting sticking curve.\n"

    "abstract": "  We first reported evidence for differential rotation of Kappa1 Ceti in Paper\nI. In this paper we demonstrate that the differential rotation pattern closely\nmatches that for the Sun. This result is based on additional MOST\n(Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) observations in 2004 and 2005, to\ncomplement the 2003 observations discussed in Paper I. Using StarSpotz, a\nprogram developed specifically to analyze MOST photometry, we have solved for\nk, the differential rotation coefficient, and P_{EQ},, the equatorial rotation\nperiod using the light curves from all three years. The spots range in latitude\nfrom 10 to 75 degrees and k = 0.090^{+0.006},_{-0.005}, -- less than the solar\nvalue but consistent with the younger age of the star. k is also well\nconstrained by the independent spectroscopic estimate of vsini. We demonstrate\nindependently that the pattern of differential rotation with latitude in fact\nconforms to solar.\n  Details are given of the parallel tempering formalism used in finding the\nmost robust solution which gives P_{EQ}, = 8.77^{+0.03},_{-0.04}, days -- smaller\nthan that usually adopted, implying an age < 750 My. Our values of P_{EQ}, and k\ncan explain the range of rotation periods determined by others by spots or\nactivity at a variety of latitudes. Historically, Ca II activity seems to occur\nconsistently between latitudes 50 and 60 degrees which might indicate a\npermanent magnetic feature. Knowledge of k and P_{EQ}, are key to understanding\nthe dynamo mechanism and rotation structure in the convective zone as well\nassessing age for solar-type stars. We recently published values of k and\nP_{EQ}, for epsilon Eri based on MOST photometry and expect to analyze MOST\nlight curves for several more spotted, solar-type stars.\n"

    "abstract": "  Category theory has foundational importance because it provides conceptual\nlenses to characterize what is important in mathematics. Originally the main\nlenses were universal mapping properties and natural transformations. In recent\ndecades, the notion of adjoint functors has moved to center-stage as category\ntheory's primary tool to characterize what is important in mathematics. Our\nfocus here is to present a theory of adjoint functors. The basis for the theory\nis laid by first showing that the object-to-object \"heteromorphisms\" between\nthe objects of different categories (e.g., insertion of generators as a set to\ngroup map) can be rigorously treated within category theory. The heteromorphic\ntheory shows that all adjunctions arise from the birepresentations of the\nheteromorphisms between the objects of different categories.\n"

    "abstract": "  Using a large sample of spiral galaxies for which 21 cm single-dish and/or\nlong-slit optical spectra are available, we make a detailed comparison between\nvarious estimates of rotational widths. Different optical width estimators are\nconsidered and their limitations discussed, with emphasis on biases associated\nwith rotation curve properties (shape and extent) and disk central surface\nbrightness. The best match with HI rotational velocities is obtained with\nPolyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixed\nfraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotation\ncurve. In contrast with Polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measured\nat 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from HI widths by an amount that\ncorrelates with the central surface brightness of the disk. This bias occurs\nbecause the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15\nr_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases with\nincreasing disk surface brightness. Statistical corrections, parameterized by\nthe radial extent of the observed rotation curve, are provided to reduce Polyex\nand HI width measurements into a homogeneous system. This yields a single\nrobust estimate of rotational velocity to be used for applications of disk\nscaling relations.\n"

    "abstract": "  Long, cylindrical metal nanowires have recently been observed to form and be\nstable for seconds at a time at room temperature. Their stability and\nstructural dynamics is well described by a continuum model, the nanoscale\nfree-electron model, which predicts cylinders in certain intervals of radius to\nbe linearly unstable. In this paper, I study how a small, localized\nperturbation of such an unstable wire grows exponentially and propagates along\nthe wire with a well-defined front. The front is found to be pulled, and forms\na coherent pattern behind it. It is well described by a linear marginal\nstability analysis of front propagation into an unstable state. In some cases,\nnonlinearities of the wire dynamics are found to trigger an invasive mode that\npushes the front. Experimental procedures that could lead to the observation of\nthis phenomenon are suggested.\n"

    "title": "The Density Profile of Local Ellipticals as Violently Relaxed,\n  Collisionless, Dissipationless Systems",
    "abstract": "  In a series of recent papers, a new formalism has been developed that\nexplains the inner structure of dark matter halos as collisionless,\ndissipationless systems assembled through mergers and accretion at the typical\ncosmological rate. Nearby ellipticals are also collisionless, dissipationless\nsystems assembling their mass through mergers, but contrarily to the former\nstructures they do not continuously accrete external matter because they are\nshielded by their host halos. Here we explore the idea that the infall of their\nown matter ejected within the halo on the occasion of a violent merger can play\na role similar to external accretion in halos. The predicted stellar mass\ndensity profile fits the observed one, and the empirical total mass density\nprofile is also recovered.\n"

    "abstract": "  Noncritical M-theory in 2+1 dimensions has been defined as a double-scaling\nlimit of a nonrelativistic Fermi liquid on a flat two-dimensional plane. Here\nwe study this noncritical M-theory in the limit of high energies, analogous to\nthe \\alpha'\\to\\infty limit of string theory. In the related case of\ntwo-dimensional Type 0A strings, it has been argued that the conformal\n\\alpha'\\to\\infty limit leads to AdS_2 with a propagating fermion whose mass is\nset by the value of the RR flux. Here we provide evidence that in the\nhigh-energy limit, the natural ground state of noncritical M-theory similarly\ndescribes the AdS_2\\times S^1 spacetime, with a massless propagating fermion.\nWe argue that the spacetime effective theory in this background is captured by\na topological higher-spin extension of conformal Chern-Simons gravity in 2+1\ndimensions, consistently coupled to a massless Dirac field. Intriguingly, the\ntwo-dimensional plane populated by the original nonrelativistic fermions is\nessentially the twistor space associated with the symmetry group of the\nAdS_2\\times S^1 spacetime; thus, at least in the high-energy limit, noncritical\nM-theory can be nonperturbatively described as a \"Fermi liquid on twistor\nspace.\"\n"

    "abstract": "  Electroweak theory joins electromagnetism with the weak force in a single\nquantum field theory, ascribing the two fundamental interactions--so different\nin their manifestations--to a common symmetry principle. How the electroweak\ngauge symmetry is hidden is one of the most urgent and challenging questions\nfacing particle physics. The provisional answer incorporated in the \"standard\nmodel\" of particle physics was formulated in the 1960s by Higgs, by Brout &\nEnglert, and by Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble: The agent of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is an elementary scalar field whose self-interactions select a vacuum\nstate in which the full electroweak symmetry is hidden, leaving a residual\nphase symmetry of electromagnetism. By analogy with the Meissner effect of the\nsuperconducting phase transition, the Higgs mechanism, as it is commonly known,\nconfers masses on the weak force carriers W and Z. It also opens the door to\nmasses for the quarks and leptons, and shapes the world around us. It is a good\nstory--though an incomplete story--and we do not know how much of the story is\ntrue. Experiments that explore the Fermi scale (the energy regime around 1 TeV)\nduring the next decade will put the electroweak theory to decisive test, and\nmay uncover new elements needed to construct a more satisfying completion of\nthe electroweak theory. The aim of this article is to set the stage by\nreporting what we know and what we need to know, and to set some \"Big\nQuestions\" that will guide our explorations.\n"

    "abstract": "  This paper focuses on supergravity duals of BPS states in N=4 super\nYang-Mills. In order to describe these duals, we begin with a sequence of\nbreathing mode reductions of IIB supergravity: first on S^3, then S^3 x S^1,\nand finally on S^3 x S^1 x CP^1. We then follow with a complete supersymmetry\nanalysis, yielding 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 BPS configurations, respectively (where in\nthe last step we take the Hopf fibration of S^3). The 1/8 BPS geometries, which\nhave an S^3 isometry and are time-fibered over a six-dimensional base, are\ndetermined by solving a non-linear equation for the Kahler metric on the base.\nSimilarly, the 1/4 BPS configurations have an S^3 x S^1 isometry and a\nfour-dimensional base, whose Kahler metric obeys another non-linear,\nMonge-Ampere type equation.\n  Despite the non-linearity of the problem, we develop a universal bubbling AdS\ndescription of these geometries by focusing on the boundary conditions which\nensure their regularity. In the 1/8 BPS case, we find that the S^3 cycle\nshrinks to zero size on a five-dimensional locus inside the six-dimensional\nbase. Enforcing regularity of the full solution requires that the interior of a\nsmooth, generally disconnected five-dimensional surface be removed from the\nbase. The AdS_5 x S^5 ground state corresponds to excising the interior of an\nS^5, while the 1/8 BPS excitations correspond to deformations (including\ntopology change) of the S^5 and/or the excision of additional droplets from the\nbase. In the case of 1/4 BPS configurations, by enforcing regularity\nconditions, we identify three-dimensional surfaces inside the four-dimensional\nbase which separate the regions where the S^3 shrinks to zero size from those\nwhere the S^1 shrinks.\n"

    "title": "Swift observations of GRB 060614: an anomalous burst with a well behaved\n  afterglow",
    "abstract": "  GRB 060614 is a remarkable GRB observed by Swift with puzzling properties,\nwhich challenge current progenitor models. The lack of any bright SN down to\nvery strict limits and the vanishing spectral lags are typical of short GRBs,\nstrikingly at odds with the long (102s) duration of this event. Here we present\nspectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that the\nburst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic break\nis observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with the\nbreak in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviour\nand the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the best\nexamples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglow\nlight curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there is\nstrong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a break\nfrequency through the optical/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early times\nand the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying at\nhigher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-ray\nlight curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extended\nemission. Spectral analysis of BAT/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show that\nthe Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRT\nobservation. The Ep continues to decrease through the XRT energy band and exits\nit at about 500s after the trigger. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24\nkeV but larger than 8 keV. The initial peak observed by BAT is however\ndistinctly harder than the rest with Ep ~300 keV as measured by Konus Wind.\nConsidering the time-averaged spectral properties, GRB 060614 is consistent\nwith the Eiso-Ep_rest, Egamma-Ep_rest, and Liso-Ep correlations.\n"

    "abstract": "  New measures of multipartite entanglement are constructed based on two\ndefinitions of multipartite information and different methods of optimizing\nover extensions of the states. One is a generalization of the squashed\nentanglement where one takes the mutual information of parties conditioned on\nthe state's extension and takes the infimum over such extensions. Additivity of\nthe multipartite squashed entanglement is proved for both versions of the\nmultipartite information which turn out to be related. The second one is based\non taking classical extensions. This scheme is generalized, which enables to\nconstruct measures of entanglement based on the {\\it mixed convex roof}, of a\nquantity, which in contrast to the standard convex roof method involves\noptimization over all decompositions of a density matrix rather than just the\ndecompositions into pure states. As one of the possible applications of these\nresults we prove that any multipartite monotone is an upper bound on the amount\nof multipartite distillable key. The findings are finally related to analogous\nresults in classical key agreement.\n"

The deep and wide\nbroadband and narrowband imaging simultaneously revealed the perspective\nstructure of these two high-z populations. The LBGs without Ly-alpha emission\nform a filamentary structure including the QSO, while the LAEs are distributed\naround the QSO but avoid it within a distance of ~4.5Mpc. On the other hand, we\nserendipitously discovered a protocluster with a significant concentration of\nLBGs and LAEs where no strongly UV ionizing source such as a QSO or radio\ngalaxy is known to exist. In this cluster field, two populations are spatially\ncross-correlated with each other. The relative spatial distribution of LAEs to\nLBGs is in stark contrast between the QSO and the cluster fields. We also found\na weak trend showing that the number counts based on Ly-alpha and UV continuum\nfluxes of LAEs in the QSO field are slightly lower than in the cluster field,\nwhereas the number counts of LBGs are almost consistent with each other. The\nLAEs avoid the nearby region around the QSO where the local UV background\nradiation could be ~100 times stronger than the average for the epoch. The\nclustering segregation between LBGs and LAEs seen in the QSO field could be due\nto either enhanced early galaxy formation in an overdense environment having\ncaused all the LAEs to evolve into LBGs, or local photoionization due to the\nstrong UV radiation from the QSO effectively causing a deficit in low-mass\ngalaxies like LAEs.\n"

Reionization increases the measured clustering of emitters,\nand we show that this enhancement would be essentially impossible to attribute\nto anything other than reionization. Our results motivate looking for the\nsignature of reionization in existing LAE data. We find that for stellar\nreionization scenarios the angular correlation function of the 58 LAEs in the\nSubaru Deep Field z = 6.6 photometric sample is more consistent with a fully\nionized universe (mean volume ionized fraction x_i = 1) than a universe with\nx_i < 0.5 at >2-sigma confidence level. Measurements in the next year on Subaru\nwill increase their z = 6.6 LAE sample by a factor of five and tighten these\nlimits. If the clustering signature of reionization is detected in a LAE\nsurvey, a comparison with a Lyman-break or a H-alpha survey in the same field\nwould confirm the reionization hypothesis. We discuss the optimal LAE survey\nspecifications for detecting reionization, with reference to upcoming programs.\n"

    "abstract": "  In papers I and II in this series, we presented hydrodynamical simulations of\njet models with parameters representative of the symbiotic system MWC 560.\nThese were simulations of a pulsed, initially underdense jet in a high density\nambient medium. Since the pulsed emission of the jet creates internal shocks\nand since the jet velocity is very high, the jet bow shock and the internal\nshocks are heated to high temperatures and should therefore emit X-ray\nradiation. In this paper, we investigate in detail the X-ray properties of the\njets in our models. We have focused our study on the total X-ray luminosity and\nits temporal variability, the resulting spectra and the spatial distribution of\nthe emission. Temperature and density maps from our hydrodynamical simulations\nwith radiative cooling presented in the second paper are used together with\nemissivities calculated with the atomic database ATOMDB. The jets in our models\nshow extended and variable X-ray emission which can be characterized as a sum\nof hot and warm components with temperatures that are consistent with\nobservations of CH Cyg and R Aqr. The X-ray spectra of our model jets show\nemission line features which correspond to observed features in the spectra of\nCH Cyg. The innermost parts of our pulsed jets show iron line emission in the\n6.4 - 6.7 keV range which may explain such emission from the central source in\nR Aqr. We conclude that MWC 560 should be detectable with Chandra or\nXMM-Newton, and such X-ray observations will provide crucial for understanding\njets in symbiotic stars.\n"

These models belong to the class of {\\sl kinetically\nconstrained lattice gases}, (KCLG) which have been introduced and intensively\nstudied in physics literature as simple models for the liquid/glass transition.\nDue to the degeneracy of rates for KCLG there exists {\\sl blocked\nconfigurations}, which do not evolve under the dynamics and in general the\nhyperplanes of configurations with a fixed number of particles can be\ndecomposed into different irreducible sets. As a consequence, both the Entropy\nand Relative Entropy method cannot be straightforwardly applied to prove the\nhydrodynamic limit. In particular, some care should be put when proving the One\nand Two block Lemmas which guarantee local convergence to equilibrium. We show\nthat, for initial profiles smooth enough and bounded away from zero and one,\nthe macroscopic density profile for our KCLG evolves under the diffusive time\nscaling according to the porous medium equation. Then we prove the same result\nfor more general profiles for a slightly perturbed dynamics obtained by adding\njumps of the Symmetric Simple Exclusion. The role of the latter is to remove\nthe degeneracy of rates and at the same time they are properly slowed down in\norder not to change the macroscopic behavior. The equilibrium fluctuations and\nthe magnitude of the spectral gap for this perturbed model are also obtained.\n"

Using a set of virial relations accurate to the first post-Newtonian\norder that reflect the stationarity of each body, and redefining the masses to\ninclude 1PN and 2PN self-gravity terms, we demonstrate the complete\ncancellation of a class of potentially divergent, structure-dependent terms\nthat scale as s^{-1}, and s^{-5/2},, where s is the characteristic size of the\nbodies.

    "abstract": "  We reveal an interesting convex duality relationship between two problems:\n(a) minimizing the probability of lifetime ruin when the rate of consumption is\nstochastic and when the individual can invest in a Black-Scholes financial\nmarket; (b) a controller-and-stopper problem, in which the controller controls\nthe drift and volatility of a process in order to maximize a running reward\nbased on that process, and the stopper chooses the time to stop the running\nreward and rewards the controller a final amount at that time. Our primary goal\nis to show that the minimal probability of ruin, whose stochastic\nrepresentation does not have a classical form as does the utility maximization\nproblem (i.e., the objective's dependence on the initial values of the state\nvariables is implicit), is the unique classical solution of its\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which is a non-linear boundary-value\nproblem. We establish our goal by exploiting the convex duality relationship\nbetween (a) and (b).\n"

    "abstract": "  We present evidence for the formation of dust grains in an unusual Type Ib SN\nbased on late-time spectra of SN 2006jc. The progenitor suffered an LBV-like\noutburst just 2 yr earlier, and we propose that the dust formation is a\nconsequence of the SN blast wave overtaking that LBV-like shell. The key\nevidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red/near-IR continuum\nsource fit by 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides of\nHe I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted lines\nas dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet for\ndust formation in any SN Ib/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 d\nafter peak, while other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundred\ndays. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-up\nshell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expanding\nSN ejecta. Rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided by\nextremely high shell densities, as indicated by He I line ratios. The brief\nepoch of dust formation is accompanied by He II 4686 emission and enhanced\nX-ray emission. These clues suggest that the unusual dust formation in this\nobject was not due to properties of the SN itself, but instead -- like most\npeculiarities of SN 2006jc -- was a consequence of the dense environment\ncreated by an LBV-like eruption 2 yr before the SN.\n"

Debris trails due to mm-sized or larger particles were found\nalong the orbits of 27 comets; 4 comets had small-particle dust tails and a\nviewing geometry that made debris trails impossible to distinguish; and only 3\nhad no debris trail despite favorable observing conditions. There are now 30\nJupiter-family comets with known debris trails, of which 22 are reported in\nthis paper for the first time. The detection rate is >80%, indicating that\ndebris trails are a generic feature of short-period comets. By comparison to\norbital calculations for particles of a range of sizes ejected over 2 yr prior\nto observation, we find that particles comprising 4 debris trails are typically\nmm-sized while the remainder of the debris trails require particles larger than\nthis. The lower-limit masses of the debris trails are typically 10^11 g, and\nthe median mass loss rate is 2 kg/s. The mass-loss rate in trail particles is\ncomparable to that inferred from OH production rates and larger than that\ninferred from visible-light scattering in comae.\n"

    "abstract": "  We analyze all X-ray timing data on 1E 1207.4-5209 in supernova remnant PKS\n1209-51/52 gathered in 2000-2005, and find a highly stable rotation with\nP=424.130451(4) ms and period derivative of (9.6 +/- 9.4)E-17 s/s. This refutes\nprevious claims of large timing irregularities in these data. In the dipole\nspin-down formalism, the 2-sigma upper limit on period derivative implies an\nenergy loss rate < 1.5E32 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength B_p < 3.5E11\nG, and characteristic age tau > 24 Myr. This tau exceeds the remnant age by 3\norders of magnitude, requiring that the pulsar was born spinning at its present\nperiod. The X-ray luminosity of 1E 1207.4-5209, L(bol) ~= 2E33 ergs/s at 2 kpc,\nexceeds its spin-down energy loss, implying that L(bol) derives from residual\ncooling, and perhaps partly from accretion of supernova debris. The upper limit\non B_p is small enough to favor the electron cyclotron model for at least one\nof the prominent absorption lines in its soft X-ray spectrum. This is the\nsecond demonstrable case of a pulsar born spinning slowly and with a weak\nB-field, after PSR J1852+0040 in Kesteven 79.\n"

Unlike previous works, where a\nnoiseless public discussion channel is used for feedback, the feed-forward and\nfeedback signals share the same noisy channel in the present model. Quite\ninterestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in\nthe current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additive\nchannel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is\nshown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity\nto the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the\nwiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a\nprivate key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novel\nfeedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (even\nwhen the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination\nchannel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property of\nthe channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption over\nthe channel without revealing its key to the source. Finally, this scheme is\nextended to the continuous real valued modulo-$\\Lambda$ channel where it is\nshown that the perfect secrecy capacity with feedback is also equal to the\ncapacity in the absence of the wiretapper.\n"

Much of the controversy stems from simulations of mixture model\ndata on a given tree topology for which reconstruction algorithms output a tree\nof a different topology; these findings were held up to show the shortcomings\nof particular tree reconstruction methods. In so doing, the underlying\nassumption was that mixture model data on one topology can be distinguished\nfrom data evolved on an unmixed tree of another topology given enough data and\nthe ``correct'' method.

The armchair edge\nGNR channel shares similarities with a zigzag CNT, but it has a different\ngeometry and quantum confinement boundary condition in the transverse\ndirection. The results indicate that the I-V characteristics are ambipolar and\nstrongly depend on the GNR width because the bandgap of the GNR is\napproximately inversely proportional to its width, which agrees with recent\nexperiments. A multiple gate geometry improves immunity to short channel\neffects, but it offers smaller improvement than it does for Si MOSFETs in terms\nof the on-current and transconductance. Reducing the oxide thickness is more\nuseful for improving transistor performance than using a high-k gate insulator.\nSignificant increase of the minimal leakage current is observed when the\nchannel length is scaled below 10nm because the small effective mass\nfacilitates strong source-drain tunneling. The GNRFET, therefore, does not\npromise extending the ultimate scaling limit of Si MOSFETs. The intrinsic\nswitching speed of a GNR SBFET, however, is several times faster than that of\nSi MOSFETs, which could lead to promising high speed electronics applications,\nwhere the large leakage of GNR SBFETs is of less concern.\n"

In the present paper we study and explain phenomenologically a\nconnection between dynamical, topological, and statistical properties of\nchaotic mixing and transport in the model flow in terms of dynamical traps,\nsingular zones in the phase space where particles may spend arbitrary long but\nfinite time [Zaslavsky, Phys. D {\\bf 168--169},, 292 (2002)]. The transport of\npassive particles is described in terms of lengths and durations of zonal\nflights which are events between two successive changes of sign of zonal\nvelocity. Some peculiarities of the respective probability density functions\nfor short flights are proven to be caused by the so-called rotational-islands\ntraps connected with the boundaries of resonant islands (including those of the\nvortex cores) filled with the particles moving in the same frame. Whereas, the\nstatistics of long flights can be explained by the influence of the so-called\nballistic-islands traps filled with the particles moving from a frame to frame.\n"

We show that the degree of\nentanglement and the time it takes for the entanglement to reach its optimum\nvalue is a sensitive function the initial conditions and the position of the\natoms inside the cavity mode. It is found that the entangled properties of the\ntwo atoms can readily be extracted from dynamics of a simple two-level system.\nEffectively, we engineer two coupled qubits whose the dynamics are analogous to\nthat of a driven single two-level system. It is found that spatial variations\nof the coupling constants actually help to create transient entanglement which\nmay appear on the time scale much longer than that predicted for the case of\nequal coupling constants. When the atoms are initially prepared in an entangled\nstate, they may remain entangled for all times. We also find that the\nentanglement exhibits an interesting phenomenon of diffraction when the the\natoms are located between the nodes and antinodes of the cavity mode. The\ndiffraction pattern of the entanglement varies with time and we explain this\neffect in terms of the quantum property of complementarity, which is manifested\nas a tradeoff between the knowledge of energy of the exchanged photon versus\nthe evolution time of the system.\n"

This system was originally developed for the MAGNUM 2-m telescope,\nwhich has been achieving unmanned and automated monitoring observation of\nactive galactic nuclei at Haleakala on the Hawaiian island of Maui since 2001.\nUsing a thermal imager and two aspherical mirrors, it at once sees almost the\nwhole sky at a wavelength of $\\lambda\\sim 10\\mu{\\rm m},$. Its outdoor part is\nweather-proof and is totally maintenance-free. The images obtained every one or\ntwo minutes are analysed immediately into several ranks of weather condition,\nfrom which our automated observing system not only decides to open or close the\ndome, but also selects what types of observations should be done. The whole-sky\ndata accumulated over four years show that 50$-$60 % of all nights are\nphotometric, and about 75 % are observable with respect to cloud condition at\nHaleakala. Many copies of this system are now used all over the world such as\nMauna Kea in Hawaii, Atacama in Chile, and Okayama and Kiso in Japan.\n"

Using the SDSS DR5 and DR4plus data, we select our early-type galaxy\nsample in the color versus color-gradient space, and we classify the spectral\ntypes of the selected early-type galaxies into normal, star-forming, Seyfert,\nand LINER classes, using several spectral line flux ratios. We investigate the\nslope in the fundamental space for each class of early-type galaxies and find\nthat there are obvious differences in the slopes of the fundamental planes\n(FPs) among the different classes of early-type galaxies, in the sense that the\nslopes for Seyferts and star-forming galaxies are flatter than those for normal\ngalaxies and LINERs. This may be the first identification of the systematic\nvariation of the FP slope among the subclasses of early-type galaxies. The\ndifference in the FP slope might be caused by the difference in the degree of\nnonhomology among different classes or by the difference of gas contents in\ntheir merging progenitors. One possible scenario is that the AGN host galaxies\nand star-forming galaxies are formed by gas-rich merging and that they may\nevolve into normal early-type galaxies after finishing their star formation or\nAGN activities.\n"

    "abstract": "  The energy density of the universe today may be dominated by the vacuum\nenergy of a slowly rolling scalar field. Making a quantum expansion around such\na time dependent solution is found to break fundamental symmetries of quantum\nfield theory. We call this mechanism cosmological symmetry breaking and argue\nthat it is different from the standard phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking. We illustrate this with a toy scalar field theory, whose action\ndisplays a U(1) symmetry. We identify a symmetry, called pseudo-scale\ninvariance, which sets the cosmological constant exactly equal to zero, both in\nclassical and quantum theory. This symmetry is also broken cosmologically and\nleads to a nonzero vacuum or dark energy. The slow roll condition along with\nthe observed value of dark energy leads to a value of the background scalar\nfield of the order of Planck mass. We also consider a U(1) gauge symmetry\nmodel. Cosmological symmetry breaking, in this case, leads to a non zero mass\nfor the vector field. We also show that a cosmologically broken pseudo-scale\ninvariance can generate a wide range of masses.\n"

Numerical results are\npresented for a number of unstable modes in a model of SPB star, at rotation\nrates up to 250 km/s. It is shown that rotation has a large effect on mode\nvisibility in light and in mean radial velocity variations. In most cases, fast\nrotation impairs mode detectability of g-modes in light variation, as Townsend\n(2003b) has already noted, but it helps detection in radial velocity variation.\nThe mixed modes, which exist only at sufficiently fast rotation, are also more\neasily seen in radial velocity. The amplitude ratios and phase differences are\nstrongly dependent on the aspect, the rotational velocity and on the mode. The\nlatter dependence is essential for mode identification.\n"

    "title": "The 3D soft X-ray cluster-AGN cross-correlation function in the ROSAT\n  NEP survey",
    "abstract": "  X-ray surveys facilitate investigations of the environment of AGNs. Deep\nChandra observations revealed that the AGNs source surface density rises near\nclusters of galaxies. The natural extension of these works is the measurement\nof spatial clustering of AGNs around clusters and the investigation of relative\nbiasing between active galactic nuclei and galaxies near clusters.The major\naims of this work are to obtain a measurement of the correlation length of AGNs\naround clusters and a measure of the averaged clustering properties of a\ncomplete sample of AGNs in dense environments. We present the first measurement\nof the soft X-ray cluster-AGN cross-correlation function in redshift space\nusing the data of the ROSAT-NEP survey. The survey covers 9x9 deg^2 around the\nNorth Ecliptic Pole where 442 X-ray sources were detected and almost completely\nspectroscopically identified. We detected a >3sigma significant clustering\nsignal on scales s<50 h70^-1 Mpc. We performed a classical maximum-likelihood\npower-law fit to the data and obtained a correlation length s_0=8.7+1.2-0.3\nh_70-1 Mpc and a slope gamma=1.7$^+0.2_-0.7 (1sigma errors). This is a strong\nevidence that AGNs are good tracers of the large scale structure of the\nUniverse. Our data were compared to the results obtained by cross-correlating\nX-ray clusters and galaxies. We observe, with a large uncertainty, that the\nbias factor of AGN is similar to that of galaxies.\n"

We address ALMA's ability to\ndetect and recover this information, using the probability distribution\nfunction (PDF) of phase increments, and the related concepts of phase entropy\nand phase structure quantity. We show that ALMA, with its high dynamical range,\nis definitely needed to achieve significant detection of phase structure, and\nthat it will do so even in the presence of a fair amount of atmospheric phase\nnoise.

    "abstract": "  This survey is a collection of various results and formulas by different\nauthors on the areas (integrals) of five related processes, viz.\\spacefactor\n=1000 Brownian motion, bridge, excursion, meander and double meander; for the\nBrownian motion and bridge, which take both positive and negative values, we\nconsider both the integral of the absolute value and the integral of the\npositive (or negative) part. This gives us seven related positive random\nvariables, for which we study, in particular, formulas for moments and Laplace\ntransforms; we also give (in many cases) series representations and asymptotics\nfor density functions and distribution functions. We further study Wright's\nconstants arising in the asymptotic enumeration of connected graphs; these are\nknown to be closely connected to the moments of the Brownian excursion area.\nThe main purpose is to compare the results for these seven Brownian areas by\nstating the results in parallel forms; thus emphasizing both the similarities\nand the differences. A recurring theme is the Airy function which appears in\nslightly different ways in formulas for all seven random variables. We further\nwant to give explicit relations between the many different similar notations\nand definitions that have been used by various authors. There are also some new\nresults, mainly to fill in gaps left in the literature. Some short proofs are\ngiven, but most proofs are omitted and the reader is instead referred to the\noriginal sources.\n"

    "abstract": "  Astronomers carry out observations to explore the diverse processes and\nobjects which populate our Universe. High-energy physicists carry out\nexperiments to approach the Fundamental Theory underlying space, time and\nmatter. Dark Energy is a unique link between them, reflecting deep aspects of\nthe Fundamental Theory, yet apparently accessible only through astronomical\nobservation. Large sections of the two communities have therefore converged in\nsupport of astronomical projects to constrain Dark Energy. In this essay I\nargue that this convergence can be damaging for astronomy. The two communities\nhave different methodologies and different scientific cultures. By uncritically\nadopting the values of an alien system, astronomers risk undermining the\nfoundations of their own current success and endangering the future vitality of\ntheir field. Dark Energy is undeniably an interesting problem to attack through\nastronomical observation, but it is one of many and not necessarily the one\nwhere significant progress is most likely to follow a major investment of\nresources.\n"

These relations have been compared to previous X-ray survey\nand to the most recent X-ray background model finding an excellent agreement.\nThe slightly different normalizations observed in the source counts of COSMOS\nand previous surveys can be largely explained as a combination of low counting\nstatistics and cosmic variance introduced by the large scale structure.\n"

The most recent determination of the solar chemical composition,\nusing a time-dependent, 3D hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere,\nexhibits a significant decrease of C, N, O abundances compared to their\nprevious values. Solar models that use these new abundances are not consistent\nwith helioseismological determinations of the sound speed profile, the surface\nhelium abundance and the convection zone depth. Aims. We investigate the effect\nof changes of solar abundances on low degree p-mode and g-mode characteristics\nwhich are strong constraints of the solar core. We consider particularly the\nincrease of neon abundance in the new solar mixture in order to reduce the\ndiscrepancy between models using new abundances and helioseismology. Methods.\nThe observational determinations of solar frequencies from the GOLF instrument\nare used to test solar models computed with different chemical compositions. We\nconsider in particular the normalized small frequency spacings in the low\ndegree p-mode frequency range. Results. Low-degree small frequency spacings are\nvery sensitive to changes in the heavy-element abundances, notably neon. We\nshow that by considering all the seismic constraints, including the small\nfrequency spacings, a rather large increase of neon abundance by about (0.5 +/-\n0.05)dex can be a good solution to the discrepancy between solar models that\nuse new abundances and low degree helioseismology, subject to adjusting\nslightly the solar age and the highest abundances. We also show that the change\nin solar abundances, notably neon, considerably affects g-mode frequencies,\nwith relative frequency differences between the old and the new models higher\nthan 1.5%\n"

    "abstract": "  A secure human identification protocol aims at authenticating human users to\na remote server when even the users' inputs are not hidden from an adversary.\nRecently, the authors proposed a human identification protocol in the RSA\nConference 2007, which is loosely based on the ability of humans to efficiently\nprocess an image. The advantage being that an automated adversary is not\neffective in attacking the protocol without human assistance. This paper\nextends that work by trying to solve some of the open problems. First, we\nanalyze the complexity of defeating the proposed protocols by quantifying the\nworkload of a human adversary. Secondly, we propose a new construction based on\ntextual CAPTCHAs (Reverse Turing Tests) in order to make the generation of\nautomated challenges easier. We also present a brief experiment involving real\nhuman users to find out the number of possible attributes in a given image and\ngive some guidelines for the selection of challenge questions based on the\nresults. Finally, we analyze the previously proposed protocol in detail for the\nrelationship between the secrets. Our results show that we can construct human\nidentification protocols based on image evaluation with reasonably\n``quantified'' security guarantees based on our model.\n"

In this paper we show that\nthis definition is incomplete without considering a third class of solutions.\nIndeed, studying these three classes reveals a degeneracy of possible\ncondensate definitions leading to a whole range of values. However, we show\nthat the {\\it physical}, condensate may in fact be extracted by simple fitting\nto the Operator Product Expansion, a procedure which is stabilised by\nconsidering the three classes of solution together.

Lastly, the role of a fourth class of noded\nsolutions is briefly discussed.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present a survey of mid-infrared gas-phase lines toward a sample of 76\ncircumstellar disks around low mass pre-main sequence stars from the Spitzer\n\"Cores to Disks\" legacy program. We report the first detections of [Ne II] and\n[Fe I] toward classical T Tauri stars in ~20% respectively ~9% of our sources.\nThe observed [Ne II] line fluxes and upper limits are consistent with [Ne II]\nexcitation in an X-ray irradiated disk around stars with X-ray luminosities\nL_X=10^{29},-10^{31}, erg s^{-1},. [Fe I] is detected at ~10^-5-10^-4 L_Sun, but\nno [S I] or [Fe II] is detected down to ~10^{-6}, L_Sun. The [Fe I] detections\nindicate the presence of gas-rich disks with masses of >~0.1 M_J. No H_2 0-0\nS(0) and S(1) disk emission is detected, except for S(1) toward one source.\nThese data give upper limits on the warm (T~100-200K) gas mass of a few Jovian\nmasses, consistent with recent T Tauri disk models which include gas heating by\nstellar radiation. Compact disk emission of hot (T>~500K) gas is observed\nthrough the H_2 0-0 S(2) and/or S(3) lines toward ~8% of our sources. The line\nfluxes are, however, higher by more than an order of magnitude than those\npredicted by recent disk models, even when X-ray and excess UV radiation are\nincluded. Similarly the [Ne II]/H_2 0-0 S(2) ratios for these sources are lower\nthan predicted, consistent with the presence of an additional hot molecular gas\ncomponent not included in current disk models. Oblique shocks of stellar winds\ninteracting with the disk can explain many aspects of the hot gas emission, but\nare inconsistent with the non-detection of [S I] and [Fe II] lines.\n"

Using the 1s->2p\nexcitation of the He atoms, maps of the He distribution, in particular of its\ndensity an pressure in bubbles of different diameter have been realized, thus\nproviding an indication of the involved bubble formation mechanism. However,\nthe short-range Pauli repulsion mechanism between electrons on neighboring\natoms seems insufficient to interpret minute variations of the local local\nmeasurements performed at the interface between the metal and the He bubble.\nSimulations relying on the continuum dielectric model have show that these\ndeviations could be interpreted as an interfzce polarization effect on the He\natomic transition, which should be accounted for when measuring the densities\nwithin the smaller bubbles.\n"

The continuum emission\nis highly elongated and is consistent with that expected from a nearly edge-on\ndisk. The high brightness and lack of strong molecular lines from Orion-I can\nbe used to argue against emission from dust. Collisional ionization and H-minus\nfree-free opacity, as in Mira variables, require a central star with >10^5\nLsun, which is greater than infrared observations allow. However, if\nsignificant local heating associated with accretion occurs, lower total\nluminosities are possible. Alternatively, photo-ionization from an early B-type\nstar and p+/e- bremsstrahlung can explain our observations, and Orion-I may be\nan example of ionized accretion disk surrounding a forming massive star. Such\naccretion disks may not be able to form planets efficiently.\n"

As a model system for a more\ndetailed study, we consider the quantum two-dimensional one-component plasma: a\nsystem of charged particles of one species, interacting through the logarithmic\nCoulomb potential in two dimensions, in a uniformly charged background of\nopposite sign, such that the total charge vanishes. The corresponding classical\nsystem is exactly solvable in a variety of geometries, including the present\none of a half-plane, when $\\beta e^2=2$, where $\\beta$ is the inverse\ntemperature and $e$ is the charge of a particle: all the classical $n$-body\ndensities are known. For the quantum one-component plasma, two sum rules\ninvolving the truncated two-body density (and, for one of them, the density\nprofile) have been derived, a long time ago, by heuristic macroscopic\narguments: one sum rule is about the asymptotic form along the wall of the\ntruncated two-body density, the other one is about the dipole moment of the\nstructure factor. In the two-dimensional case at $\\beta e^2=2$, we have now\nexplicit expressions up to order $\\hbar^2$ of these two quantum densities, thus\nwe can microscopically check the sum rules at this order. The checks are\npositive, reinforcing the idea that the sum rules are correct.\n"

Several different\napproaches have been proposed, one of the most recent is PROMISE\n(Potsdam-ROssendorf Magnetorotational InStability Experiment). It consists of a\nflow of a liquid metal between two rotating cylinders under applied\ncurrent-free spiral magnetic field.

Given a fixed price,\nagents decide repeatedly whether to buy or not a unit of a good, so as to\nmaximize their expected utilities. We show that the equilibrium reached by the\nsystem depends on the nature of the information agents use to estimate their\nexpected utilities.\n"

    "abstract": "  The process of annealing of a CdTe:Cl ingot during its cooling after growth\nwas studied. The annealing was performed in two stages: a high-temperature\nstage, with an approximate equality of chlorine and cadmium vacancy\nconcentrations established at the thermodynamic equilibrium between the crystal\nand vapors of volatile components, and a low-temperature stage, with charged\ndefects interacting to form neutral associations. The chlorine concentrations\nnecessary to obtain semi-insulating crystals were determined for various ingot\ncooling rates in the high temperature stage. The dependence of the chlorine\nconcentration [Cl+Te] in the ingot on the temperature of annealing in the\nhigh-temperature stage was found. The carrier lifetimes and drift mobilities\nwere obtained in relation to the temperature and cadmium vapor pressure in the\npostgrowth annealing of the ingot.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present an inverse scattering approach to defects in classical integrable\nfield theories. Integrability is proved systematically by constructing the\ngenerating function of the infinite set of modified integrals of motion. The\ncontribution of the defect to all orders is explicitely identified in terms of\na defect matrix. The underlying geometric picture is that those defects\ncorrespond to Backlund transformations localized at a given point. A\nclassification of defect matrices as well as the corresponding defect\nconditions is performed. The method is applied to a collection of well-known\nintegrable models and previous results are recovered (and extended) directly as\nspecial cases. Finally, a brief discussion of the classical $r$-matrix approach\nin this context shows the relation to inhomogeneous lattice models and the need\nto resort to lattice regularizations of integrable field theories with defects.\n"

    "abstract": "  Millimeter interferometry provides evidence for the presence of mm to cm size\n\"pebbles\" in the outer parts of disks around pre-main-sequence stars. The\nobservations suggest that large grains are produced relatively early in disk\nevolution (< 1 Myr) and remain at large radii for longer periods of time (5 to\n10 Myr). Simple theoretical estimates of the radial drift time of solid\nparticles, however, imply that they would drift inward over a time scale of\nless than 0.1 Myr. In this paper, we address this conflict between theory and\nobservation, using more detailed theoretical models, including the effects of\nsedimentation, collective drag forces and turbulent viscosity. We find that,\nalthough these effects slow down the radial drift of the dust particles, this\nreduction is not sufficient to explain the observationally determined long\nsurvival time of mm/cm-sized grains in protoplanetary disks. However, if for\nsome reason the gas to dust ratio in the disk is reduced by at least a factor\nof 20 from the canonical value of 100 (for instance through photoevaporation of\nthe gas), then the radial drift time scales become sufficiently large to be in\nagreement with observations.\n"

    "abstract": "  We consider a model of socially interacting individuals that make a binary\nchoice in a context of positive additive endogenous externalities. It\nencompasses as particular cases several models from the sociology and economics\nliterature. We extend previous results to the case of a general distribution of\nidiosyncratic preferences, called here Idiosyncratic Willingnesses to Pay\n(IWP). Positive additive externalities yield a family of inverse demand curves\nthat include the classical downward sloping ones but also new ones with non\nconstant convexity. When j, the ratio of the social influence strength to the\nstandard deviation of the IWP distribution, is small enough, the inverse demand\nis a classical monotonic (decreasing) function of the adoption rate. Even if\nthe IWP distribution is mono-modal, there is a critical value of j above which\nthe inverse demand is non monotonic, decreasing for small and high adoption\nrates, but increasing within some intermediate range. Depending on the price\nthere are thus either one or two equilibria. Beyond this first result, we\nexhibit the generic properties of the boundaries limiting the regions where the\nsystem presents different types of equilibria (unique or multiple). These\nproperties are shown to depend only on qualitative features of the IWP\ndistribution: modality (number of maxima), smoothness and type of support\n(compact or infinite). The main results are summarized as phase diagrams in the\nspace of the model parameters, on which the regions of multiple equilibria are\nprecisely delimited.\n"

Some of the available observations of the evolution of sulphur\nwith metallicity indicate an increased scatter of sulphur to iron ratios at low\nmetallicities or even a bimodal distribution, with some stars showing constant\nS/Fe at all metallicities and others showing an increasing S/Fe ratio with\ndecreasing metallicity. In metal-poor stars SI lines of Multiplet 1 at 920 nm\nare not yet too weak to permit to measure the sulphur abundance A(S), however\nin ground-based observations they are severely affected by telluric lines. aims\n: We investigate the possibility to measure sulphur abundances from SI Mult. 3\nat 1045 nm lines, which lie in the near infra-red. These are slightly weaker\nthan those of Mult. 1, but lie in a range not affected by telluric lines.\nmethod We investigate the lines of Mult.3 in the Sun (G2V), Procyon (F5V), HD\n33256 (F5V), HD 25069 (G9V) and epsilon Eri (HD 22049, K2V). For the Sun and\nProcyon the analysis has been performed with CO5BOLD 3D hydrodynamical model\natmospheres, for the other three stars, for which hydrodynamical simulations\nare not available, the analysis has been performed using 1D model atmospheres.\nresults For our sample of stars we find a global agreement of A(S) from lines\nof different multiplets. conclusions : Our results suggest that the infrared\nlines of Mult. 3 are a viable indicator of the sulphur abundance which, because\nof the intrinsic strength of this multiplet, should be suitable to study the\ntrend of [S/Fe] at low metallicities.\n"

When coupled with data of other two TO stars of the cluster,\navailable in the literature, the full range in Li abundances observed in this\ncluster is 1.6<~A(Li)<~ 2.3. The variation in A(Li) is at least 0.6 dex (0.7\ndex considering also the data available in the literature) and the scatter is\nsix times larger than what expected from the observational error. We claim that\nthese variations are real. A(Li) seems to be anti-correlated with A(Na) exactly\nas observed in NGC 6752. No systematic error in our analysis could produce such\nan anti-correlation. conclusions: Na production through p captures on 22Ne at\ntemperatures in excess of 3x10^7 K and the contemporary Li destruction could\nresult in this anti-correlation. However such nuclear processing cannot have\ntaken place in the stars themselves, which do not reach such high temperatures,\neven at their centre. This points towards the processing in a previous\ngeneration of stars. The low N/O ratios in the observed stars and the apparent\nlack of correlation between N an Li abundances, place a strong constraint on\nthe properties of this previous generation. Our results indicate a different\nbehaviour among the Globular Clusters so far studied as far as the abundance\npatterns are concerned.\n"

    "abstract": "  A finite element method is presented to compute time harmonic microwave\nfields in three dimensional configurations. Nodal-based finite elements have\nbeen coupled with an absorbing boundary condition to solve open boundary\nproblems. This paper describes how the modeling of large devices has been made\npossible using parallel computation, New algorithms are then proposed to\nimplement this formulation on a cluster of workstations (10 DEC ALPHA 300X) and\non a CRAY C98. Analysis of the computation efficiency is performed using simple\nproblems. The electromagnetic scattering of a plane wave by a perfect electric\nconducting airplane is finally given as example.\n"

    "title": "On Predicting the Solar Cycle using Mean-Field Models",
    "abstract": "  We discuss the difficulties of predicting the solar cycle using mean-field\nmodels. Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant\nmodulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing\nto either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implications\nfor predictability in both of these situations by considering two separate\nsolar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux\ntransport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to\nsignificant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss\nof predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and\nassume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully\ndeterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario for\nprediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with\nparameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target\ntimeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to\npredict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in\nall details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even\nshort-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the\ninput parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the\npredicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles.\nGiven the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and\nnonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting\nthe solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.\n"

The identity makes it possible to realize the gauge symmetry\neven in the presence of a momentum cutoff. In the cutoff dependent realization,\nthe abelian nature of the gauge symmetry is lost, breaking the nilpotency of\nthe BRS transformation. Using the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we extend the\nWilson action by including the antifield contributions. Then, the\nWard-Takahashi identity for the Wilson action is lifted to a quantum master\nequation, and the modified BRS transformation regains nilpotency.

    "abstract": "  The variation of the expansion rate of the Universe with time produces an\nevolution in the cosmological redshift of distant sources (for example quasar\nLyman-$\\alpha$ absorption lines), that might be directly observed by future\nultra stable, high-resolution spectrographs (such as CODEX) coupled to\nextremely large telescopes (such as European Southern Observatory's Extremely\nLarge Telescope, ELT). This would open a new window to explore the physical\nmechanism responsible for the current acceleration of the Universe. We\ninvestigate the evolution of cosmological redshift from a variety of dark\nenergy models, and compare it with simulated data. We perform a Fisher matrix\nanalysis and discuss the prospects for constraining the parameters of these\nmodels and for discriminating among competing candidates. We find that, because\nof parameter degeneracies, and of the inherent technical difficulties involved\nin this kind of observations, the uncertainties on parameter reconstruction can\nbe rather large unless strong external priors are assumed. However, the method\ncould be a valuable complementary cosmological tool, and give important\ninsights on the dynamics of dark energy, not obtainable using other probes.\n"

    "abstract": "  We consider a cognitive network consisting of n random pairs of cognitive\ntransmitters and receivers communicating simultaneously in the presence of\nmultiple primary users. Of interest is how the maximum throughput achieved by\nthe cognitive users scales with n. Furthermore, how far these users must be\nfrom a primary user to guarantee a given primary outage. Two scenarios are\nconsidered for the network scaling law: (i) when each cognitive transmitter\nuses constant power to communicate with a cognitive receiver at a bounded\ndistance away, and (ii) when each cognitive transmitter scales its power\naccording to the distance to a considered primary user, allowing the cognitive\ntransmitter-receiver distances to grow. Using single-hop transmission, suitable\nfor cognitive devices of opportunistic nature, we show that, in both scenarios,\nwith path loss larger than 2, the cognitive network throughput scales linearly\nwith the number of cognitive users. We then explore the radius of a primary\nexclusive region void of cognitive transmitters. We obtain bounds on this\nradius for a given primary outage constraint. These bounds can help in the\ndesign of a primary network with exclusive regions, outside of which cognitive\nusers may transmit freely. Our results show that opportunistic secondary\nspectrum access using single-hop transmission is promising.\n"

When the electrons interact inside the nano-system, the coefficient\n|ts(E_F)|^2 describing its effective transmission at the Fermi energy E_F\nceases to be local. This effect of electron-electron interactions upon\n|ts(E_F)|^2 is studied using a one dimensional model of spinless fermions and\nthe Hartree-Fock approximation. The non locality of |ts(E_F)|^2 is due to the\ncoupling between the Hartree and Fock corrections inside the nano-system and\nthe scatterers outside the nano-system via long range Friedel oscillations.\nUsing this phenomenon, one can vary |ts(E_F)|^2 by an Aharonov-Bohm flux\nthreading a ring which is attached to one lead at a distance Lc from the\nnano-system. For small distances Lc, the variation of the quantum conductance\ninduced by this non local effect can exceed 0.1 (e^2/h).\n"

For interspecies attraction just below this critical limit\nthere is almost complete mixing of boson and fermion components.

    "abstract": "  In this article we obtain a fundamental measure functional for the model of\naligned hard hexagons in the plane. Our aim is not just to provide a functional\nfor a new, admittedly academic, model, but to investigate the structure of\nfundamental measure theory. A model of aligned hard hexagons has similarities\nwith the hard disk model. Both share \"lost cases\", i.e. admit configurations of\nthree particles in which there is pairwise overlap but not triple overlap.\nThese configurations are known to be problematic for fundamental measure\nfunctionals, which are not able to capture their contribution correctly. This\nfailure lies in the inability of these functionals to yield a correct low\ndensity limit of the third order direct correlation function. Here we derive\nthe functional by projecting aligned hard cubes on the plane x+y+z=0. The\ncorrect dimensional crossover behavior of these functionals permits us to\nfollow this strategy. The functional of aligned hard cubes, however, does not\nhave lost cases, so neither had the resulting functional for aligned hard\nhexagons. The latter exhibits, in fact, a peculiar structure as compared to the\none for hard disks. It depends on a uniparametric family of weighted densities\nthrough a new term not appearing in the functional for hard disks. Apart from\nstudying the freezing of this system, we discuss the implications of the\nfunctional structure for new developments of fundamental measure theory.\n"

Building on work of Meshkati,\net al., wherein the tools of game-theory are used in order to achieve\nenergy-efficiency in a simple synchronous code division multiple access system,\nsystem asynchronism, the use of bandlimited chip-pulses, and the multipath\ndistortion induced by the wireless channel are explicitly incorporated into the\nanalysis.

In particular, the case in which a linear multiuser detector is adopted\nat the receiver is considered first, and then, the more challenging case in\nwhich non-linear decision feedback multiuser detectors are employed is\nconsidered. The proposed games are shown to admit a unique Nash equilibrium\npoint, while simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed\nsolutions, as well as that the use of a decision-feedback multiuser receiver\nbrings remarkable performance improvements.\n"

    "abstract": "  In this paper we introduce a variant of pushdown dimension called bounded\npushdown (BPD) dimension, that measures the density of information contained in\na sequence, relative to a BPD automata, i.e. a finite state machine equipped\nwith an extra infinite memory stack, with the additional requirement that every\ninput symbol only allows a bounded number of stack movements. BPD automata are\na natural real-time restriction of pushdown automata. We show that BPD\ndimension is a robust notion by giving an equivalent characterization of BPD\ndimension in terms of BPD compressors. We then study the relationships between\nBPD compression, and the standard Lempel-Ziv (LZ) compression algorithm, and\nshow that in contrast to the finite-state compressor case, LZ is not universal\nfor bounded pushdown compressors in a strong sense: we construct a sequence\nthat LZ fails to compress signicantly, but that is compressed by at least a\nfactor 2 by a BPD compressor. As a corollary we obtain a strong separation\nbetween finite-state and BPD dimension.\n"

    "abstract": "  We have attempted to constrain the progenitors of all supernova types,\nthrough correlations of the positions of historical supernovae with recent star\nformation, as traced by H-alpha emission. Through pixel statistics we have\nfound that a large fraction of the SNII population do not show any association\nwith current star formation, which we put down to a 'runaway' fraction of these\nprogenitors. The SNIb/c population accurately traces the H-alpha emission, with\nsome suggestion that the SNIc progenitors show a higher degree of correlation\nthan the SNIb, suggesting higher mass progenitors for the former. Overall the\nSNIa population only show a weak correlation to the positions of HII regions,\nbut as many as a half may be associated with a young stellar population.\n"

    "abstract": "  Context: The mass-loss rate is a key parameter of massive stars. Adequate\nstellar atmosphere models are required for spectral analyses and mass-loss\ndeterminations. Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity of\nstellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are optically\nthin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empirical\nmass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can be\noptically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping''\nimpacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)\nmodel atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account for\nclumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumps\nreduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergent\nspectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that the\noptically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PV\nresonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken into\naccount. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line and\nrecombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumping\nmodeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:\nMass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha line\nin O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of optically\nthick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore,\nneglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimating\nempirical mass-loss rates.\n"

These arguments are based\non the brightness temperature, $T_{b},$ exceeding $10^{12}, ^{\\circ},$ K which\nleads to the well-known inverse Compton catastrophe unless the radio jet is\nrelativistic and is viewed along its axis. In this letter, we expand the Zhou\net al sample of polar BALQSOs to the entire SDSS DR5. In the process, we\nclarify a mistake in their calculation of brightness temperature. The expanded\nsample of high $T_{b},$ BALQSOS, has an inordinately large fraction of LoBALQSOs\n(low ionization BALQSOs). We consider this an important clue to understanding\nthe nature of the polar BALQSOs. This is expected in the polar BALQSO\nanalytical/numerical models of Punsly in which LoBALQSOs occur when the line of\nsight is very close to the polar axis, where the outflow density is the\nhighest.\n"

    "abstract": "  We continue our program of single-site observations of pulsating subdwarf B\n(sdB) stars and present the results of extensive time series photometry of HS\n0039+4302 and HS 0444+0458. Both were observed at MDM Observatory during the\nfall of 2005. We extend the number of known frequencies for HS 0039+4302 from 4\nto 14 and discover one additional frequency for HS 0444+0458, bringing the\ntotal to three. We perform standard tests to search for multiplet structure,\nmeasure amplitude variations, and examine the frequency density to constrain\nthe mode degree $\\ell$.\n  Including the two stars in this paper, 23 pulsating sdB stars have received\nfollow-up observations designed to decipher their pulsation spectra. It is\nworth an examination of what has been detected. We compare and contrast the\nfrequency content in terms of richness and range and the amplitudes with\nregards to variability and diversity. We use this information to examine\nobservational correlations with the proposed $\\kappa$ pulsation mechanism as\nwell as alternative theories.\n"

As ubiquitous as they are, their precise in vivo\nproperties and their integration into the cellular function still remain\nlargely unexplored. Here, we present a multilevel approach that efficiently\nconnects in both directions molecular properties with cell physiology and use\nit to characterize the molecular properties of the looped DNA-lac repressor\ncomplex while functioning in vivo. The properties we uncover include the\npresence of two representative conformations of the complex, the stabilization\nof one conformation by DNA architectural proteins, and precise values of the\nunderlying twisting elastic constants and bending free energies.

    "abstract": "  We present radio and X-ray observations of an impulsive solar flare that was\nmoderately intense in microwaves, yet showed very meager EUV and X-ray\nemission. The flare occurred on 2001 Oct 24 and was well-observed at radio\nwavelengths by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH), the Nobeyama Radio\nPolarimeters (NoRP), and by the Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA). It was also\nobserved in EUV and X-ray wavelength bands by the TRACE, GOES, and Yohkoh\nsatellites. We find that the impulsive onset of the radio emission is\nprogressively delayed with increasing frequency relative to the onset of hard\nX-ray emission. In contrast, the time of flux density maximum is progressively\ndelayed with decreasing frequency. The decay phase is independent of radio\nfrequency. The simple source morphology and the excellent spectral coverage at\nradio wavelengths allowed us to employ a nonlinear chi-squared minimization\nscheme to fit the time series of radio spectra to a source model that accounts\nfor the observed radio emission in terms of gyrosynchrotron radiation from\nMeV-energy electrons in a relatively dense thermal plasma. We discuss plasma\nheating and electron acceleration in view of the parametric trends implied by\nthe model fitting. We suggest that stochastic acceleration likely plays a role\nin accelerating the radio-emitting electrons.\n"

The archival X-ray observations show\na hard (Gamma ~ 1.8), low luminosity (L_X ~ 4 x 10^31 ergs/s) point source at\nthe center of the nebula. Follow-up LGS-AO near-infrared imaging of the Chandra\nerror circle reveals a relatively bright (K' ~ 14 magnitude) counterpart. Both\nits color and brightness are consistent with a heavily obscured B-star or\npossibly a late-G/early-K giant. The most plausible explanation is that this\nnewly discovered X-ray source is a non-accreting B-star/pulsar binary powering\nthe radio and optical nebula. If so, the luminous Be-star discussed in the\nliterature seemingly embedded in the nebula is not the dominant force\nresponsible for shaping G70.7+1.2. Thus, we suggest that G70.7+1.2 is the\nresult of two unrelated objects (a B-star X-ray binary and a Be star)\ninteracting with a dense molecular cloud. With this explanation we believe we\nhave solved the mystery of the origin of G70.7+1.2.\n"

    "abstract": "  Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster surveys are considered among the most\npromising methods for probing dark energy up to large redshifts. However, their\npremise is hinged upon an accurate mass-observable relationship, which could be\naffected by the (rather poorly understood) physics of the intracluster gas. In\nthis letter, using a semi-analytic model of the intracluster gas that\naccommodates various theoretical uncertainties, I develop a Fundamental Plane\nrelationship between the observed size, thermal energy, and mass of galaxy\nclusters. In particular, I find that M ~ (Y_{SZ},/R_{SZ,2},)^{3/4},, where M is\nthe mass, Y_{SZ}, is the total SZ flux or thermal energy, and R_{SZ,2}, is the SZ\nhalf-light radius of the cluster. I first show that, within this model, using\nthe Fundamental Plane relationship reduces the (systematic+random) errors in\nmass estimates to 14%, from 22% for a simple mass-flux relationship. Since\nmeasurement of the cluster sizes is an inevitable part of observing the SZ\nclusters, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be used to reduce the error of\nthe cluster mass estimates by ~ 34%, improving the accuracy of the resulting\ncosmological constraints without any extra cost. I then argue why our\nFundamental Plane is distinctly different from the virial relationship that one\nmay naively expect between the cluster parameters. Finally, I argue that while\nincluding more details of the observed SZ profile cannot significantly improve\nthe accuracy of mass estimates, a better understanding of the impact of\nnon-gravitational heating/cooling processes on the outskirts of the\nintracluster medium (apart from external calibrations) might be the best way to\nreduce these errors.\n"

We\npresent a maximum-likelihood method of determining the intrinsic spectral index\ndistribution (ISID) of a population of gamma-ray emitters which accounts for\nerror in measurement of individual spectral indices, and we apply it to EGRET\nblazars. We find that the most likely Gaussian ISID for EGRET blazars has a\nmean of 2.27 and a standard deviation of 0.20. We additionally find some\nindication that FSRQs and BL Lacs may have different ISIDs (with BL Lacs being\nharder). We also test for spectral index hardening associated with blazar\nvariability for which we find no evidence. Finally, we produce simulated GLAST\nspectral index datasets and perform the same analyses. With improved statistics\ndue to the much larger number of resolvable blazars, GLAST data will help us\ndetermine the ISIDs with much improved accuracy. Should any difference exist\nbetween the ISIDs of BL Lacs and FSRQs or between the ISIDs of blazars in the\nquiescent and flaring states, GLAST data will be adequate to separate these\nISIDs at a significance better than 3 sigma.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present results of an attempt to include more detailed gas physics\nmotivated from hydrodynamical simulations within semi-analytic models (SAM) of\ngalaxy formation, focusing on the role that environmental effects play. The\nmain difference to previous SAMs is that we include 'gravitational' heating of\nthe intra-cluster medium (ICM) by the net surplus of gravitational potential\nenergy released from gas that has been stripped from infalling satellites.\nGravitational heating appears to be an efficient heating source able to prevent\ncooling in environments corresponding to dark matter halos more massive than\n$\\sim 10^{13}, $M$_{\\odot},$. The energy release by gravitational heating can\nmatch that by AGN-feedback in massive galaxies and can exceed it in the most\nmassive ones. However, there is a fundamental difference in the way the two\nprocesses operate. Gravitational heating becomes important at late times, when\nthe peak activity of AGNs is already over, and it is very mass dependent. This\nmass dependency and time behaviour gives the right trend to recover down-sizing\nin the star-formation rate of massive galaxies. Abridged...\n"

    "abstract": "  The chemical composition of Earth's atmosphere has undergone substantial\nevolution over the course of its history. It is possible, even likely, that\nterrestrial planets in other planetary systems have undergone similar changes;\nconsequently, the age distribution of nearby stars is an important\nconsideration in designing surveys for Earth-analogues. Valenti & Fischer\n(2005) provide age and metallicity estimates for 1039 FGK dwarfs in the Solar\nNeighbourhood. Using the Hipparcos catalogue as a reference to calibrate\npotential biases, we have extracted volume-limited samples of nearby stars from\nthe Valenti-Fischer dataset. Unlike other recent investigations, our analysis\nshows clear evidence for an age-metallicity relation in the local disk, albeit\nwith substantial dispersion at any epoch. The mean metallicity increases from\n-0.3 dex at a lookback time of ~10 Gyrs to +0.15 dex at the present day.\nSupplementing the Valenti-Fischer measurements with literature data to give a\ncomplete volume-limited sample, the age distribution of nearby FGK dwarfs is\nbroadly consistent with a uniform star-formation rate over the history of the\nGalactic disk. In striking contrast, most stars known to have planetary\ncompanions are younger than 5 Gyrs; however, stars with planetary companions\nwithin 0.4 AU have a significantly flatter age distribution, indicating that\nthose systems are stable on timescales of many Gyrs. Several of the older,\nlower metallicity host stars have enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios, implying\nmembership of the thick disk. If the frequency of terrestrial planets is also\ncorrelated with stellar metallicity, then the median age of such planetary\nsystem is likely to be ~3 Gyrs. We discuss the implications of this hypothesis\nin designing searches for Earth analogues among the nearby stars.\n"

I calculate, in\nparticular, the gravitational redshift of a surface atomic line, the touchdown\nluminosity of a radius-expansion burst, which is believed to be equal to the\nEddington critical luminosity, and the apparent surface area of a neutron star\nas measured during the cooling tails of bursts. I show that, for a general\nmetric theory of gravity, the apparent surface area of a neutron star depends\non the coordinate radius of the stellar surface and on its gravitational\nredshift in the exact same way as in general relativity. On the other hand, the\nEddington critical luminosity depends also on an additional parameter that\nmeasures the degree to which the general relativistic field equations are\nsatisfied. These results can be used in conjunction with current and future\nhigh-energy observations of bursting neutron stars to test general relativity\nin the strong-field regime.\n"

The\nbarrier is created by a laser beam swept through the condensate, and the\nresulting dipole potential can be either attractive or repulsive. We examine\nboth cases and find regimes of stable and unstable fluid flow: At slow speeds\nof the barrier, the fluid flow is stationary due to the superfluidity of the\ncondensate. At intermediate speeds, we observe a non-stationary regime in which\nthe condensate gets filled with dark solitons. At faster speeds, soliton\nformation completely ceases and a remarkable absence of excitation in the\ncondensate is seen again.\n"

    "abstract": "  We investigate the problem of vortex trapping in cyclically coupled\nBose-Josephson junctions. Starting with $N$ independent BECs we couple the\ncondensates through Josephson links and allow the system to reach a stable\ncirculation by adding a dissipative term in our semiclassical equations of\nmotion. The central question we address is what is the probability to trap a\nvortex with winding number $m$. Our numerical simulations reveal that the final\ndistribution of winding numbers is narrower than the initial distribution of\ntotal phases, indicating an increased probability for no-vortex configurations.\nFurther, the nonlinearity of the problem manifests itself in the somewhat\ncounter-intuitive result that it is possible to obtain a non-zero circulation\nstarting with zero total phase around the loop. The final width of the\ndistribution of winding numbers for $N$ sites scales as $\\lambda N^{\\alpha},$,\nwhere $\\alpha=0.47\\pm 0.01$ and $\\lambda <0.67$ (value predicted for the\ninitial distribution) indicating a shrinking of the final distribution. The\nactual value of $\\lambda$ is found to depend on the strength of dissipation.\n"

    "abstract": "  For many years various asymmetrical profiles of different spectral lines\nemitted from solar flares have been frequently observed. These asymmetries or\nline shifts are caused predominantly by vertical mass motions in flaring layers\nand they provide a good diagnostics for plasma flows during solar flares. There\nare many controversial results of observations and theoretical analysis of\nplasma flows in solar chromospheric flares. The main difficulty is the\ninterpretation of line shifts or asymmetries. For many years, methods based on\nbisector techniques were used but they give a reliable results only for some\nspecific conditions and in most cases cannot be applied. The most promising\napproach is to use the non-LTE techniques applied for flaring atmosphere. The\ncalculation of synthetic line profiles is performed with the radiative transfer\ntechniques and the assumed physical conditions correspond to flaring\natmosphere. I will present an overview of different observations and\ninterpretations of line asymmetries in chromospheric flares. I will explain\nwhat we have learnt about the chromospheric evaporation in the frame of\nhydrodynamical models as well as reconnection models. A critical review will be\ndone on the classical methods used to derive Doppler-shifts for optically thick\nchomospheric lines. In particular, details on the new approach for interpreting\nchromospheric line asymmetries based on the non-LTE techniques will be\npresented.\n"

Specifically, we study the level both of the horizontal (HB) and red giant\nbranches (RGB) relative to the main-sequence turnoff (TO) in the U magnitude.\nAlong with the presented photometry of M75, we use our collection of\nphotometric data on GCs belonging to the metal-poor range, [Fe/H]zw<-1.1 dex,\nobtained from observations with different equipment, but calibrated by standard\nstars situated in the observed cluster fields. We confirm our earlier finding,\nand extend it to a larger magnitude range.We demonstrate that DeltaU_{TO},^{BHB},\nexpressing the difference in U magnitude between the TO point and the level of\nthe blue HB, near its red boundary, of the metal-poor GCs observed with the\nEMMI camera of the NTT/ESO telescope is about 0.4-0.5 mag smaller as compared\nto GCs observed with the 100\" telescope and 1.3 m Warsaw telescope of the Las\nCampanas Observatory. At the same time, Delta U_{TO},^{RGB},, the difference in U\nmagnitude between the TO and RGB inflection (brightest) points, does not show\nsuch an apparent dependence on the characteristics of U filters used, but it\ndepends on cluster metallicity. We have shown, for the first time, the\ndependence of the parameter DeltaU_{TO},^{RGB}, on [Fe/H] and have estimated its\nanalytical expression, by assuming a linear relation between the parameter and\nmetallicity. Its slope, Delta U_{TO},^{RGB},/Delta [Fe/H]~1.2 mag/dex, is approx.\na factor of two steeper than that of the dependence of the RGB bump position in\nthe V magnitude on metallicity. The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) clump and\nfeatures of the RGB luminosity function (LF) of M75 are also discussed.\n"

    "abstract": "  Gravitational waves from the inspiral and coalescence of supermassive\nblack-hole (SMBH) binaries with masses ~10^6 Msun are likely to be among the\nstrongest sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We\ndescribe a three-stage data-analysis pipeline designed to search for and\nmeasure the parameters of SMBH binaries in LISA data. The first stage uses a\ntime-frequency track-search method to search for inspiral signals and provide a\ncoarse estimate of the black-hole masses m_1, m_2 and of the coalescence time\nof the binary t_c. The second stage uses a sequence of matched-filter template\nbanks, seeded by the first stage, to improve the measurement accuracy of the\nmasses and coalescence time. Finally, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo search is used\nto estimate all nine physical parameters of the binary. Using results from the\nsecond stage substantially shortens the Markov Chain burn-in time and allows us\nto determine the number of SMBH-binary signals in the data before starting\nparameter estimation. We demonstrate our analysis pipeline using simulated data\nfrom the first LISA Mock Data Challenge. We discuss our plan for improving this\npipeline and the challenges that will be faced in real LISA data analysis.\n"

Existing work\nassume that the power of the additive noise is known and use the expected value\nof the fading gain in a linear function of the channel output to find\napproximate LLRs. In this work, we first assume that the power of the additive\nnoise is known and we find the optimum linear approximation of LLRs in the\nsense of maximum achievable transmission rate on the channel. The maximum\nachievable rate under this linear LLR calculation is almost equal to the\nmaximum achievable rate under true LLR calculation. We also observe that this\nmethod appears to be the optimum in the sense of bit error rate performance\ntoo.

    "abstract": "  Surviving in a diverse environment requires corresponding organism responses.\nAt the cellular level, such adjustment relies on the transcription factors\n(TFs) which must rapidly find their target sequences amidst a vast amount of\nnon-relevant sequences on DNA molecules. Whether these transcription factors\nlocate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of\nspeculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when the\nprotein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this\npaper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by considering\na very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of\nlow affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites,\ncorresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip.\nWe study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modes\nby considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walks\nalong the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation and\nthen re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; and\na hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and then\nre-associates at a faster rate than the jumper. We analyze the final\nprobability distribution of molecules for each case and find that TFs can\nlocate their targets fast enough even if they spend 15% of their search time\ndiffusing freely in the solution. This indeed agrees with recent experimental\nresults obtained by Elf et al. 2007 and is in contrast with theoretical\nexpectation.\n"

    "abstract": "  We report precision Doppler measurements of three intermediate-mass subgiants\nfrom Lick and Keck Observatories. All three stars show variability in their\nradial velocities consistent with planet-mass companions in Keplerian orbits.\nWe find a planet with a minimum mass of 2.5 Mjup in a 351.5 day orbit around HD\n192699, a planet with a minimum mass of 2.0 Mjup in a 341.1 day orbit around HD\n210702, and a planet with a minimum mass of 0.61 Mjup in a 297.3 day orbit\naround HD 175541. Stellar mass estimates from evolutionary models indicate that\nall of these stars were formerly A-type dwarfs with masses ranging from 1.65 to\n1.85 Msun. These three long-period planets would not have been detectable\nduring their stars' main-sequence phases due to the large rotational velocities\nand stellar jitter exhibited by early-type dwarfs. There are now 9 \"retired\"\n(evolved) A-type stars (Mstar > 1.6 Msun) with known planets. All 9 planets\norbit at distances a \\geq 0.78 AU, which is significantly different than the\nsemimajor axis distribution of planets around lower-mass stars. We examine the\npossibility that the observed lack of close-in planets is due to engulfment by\ntheir expanding host stars, but we find that this explanation is inadequate\ngiven the relatively small stellar radii of K giants (Rstar < 32 Rsun = 0.15\nAU) and subgiants (Rstar < 7 Rsun = 0.03 AU). Instead, we conclude that planets\naround intermediate-mass stars reside preferentially beyond ~0.8 AU, which may\nbe a reflection of different formation and migration histories of planets\naround A-type stars.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present a multiwavelength study of the poor cluster RX J1117.4+0743 ([VMF\n98] 097) at z=0.485, based on GMOS/Gemini South g', r' photometry and\nspectroscopy, and XMM-Newton observations. We examine its nature and\nsurroundings by analyzing the projected galaxy distribution, the galaxy\nvelocity distribution, the weak-lensing mass reconstruction, and the X-ray\nspectroscopy and imaging. The cluster shows a complex morphology. It is\ncomposed by at least two structures along the line-of-sight, with velocity\ndispersions of 592+-82 km s^-1 and 391+-85 km s^-1 respectively. Other\nstructures are also detected in X-ray, in the galaxy projected number density\nmap, and by weak-lensing. One of these clumps, could be gravitationally bound\nand associated to the main cluster. The derived temperature and bolometric\nX-ray luminosity reveal that [VMF 98] 097 behave like a normal cluster, in\nagreement with Lx-Tx correlation found for both local (z=0) and moderate\nredshift (z~0.4) clusters. We find that the mass determination inferred from\nweak-lensing is in average 3 to 4.8 times higher (depending on the model\nassumed) than the X-ray mass. We have two possible explanations for this\ndiscrepancy: i) the cluster is in non-equilibrium, then the deviation of the\nX-ray estimated mass from the true value can be as high as a factor of two; ii)\nthe intervening mass along the line-of-sight of the cluster is producing an\nover-estimation of the weak-lensing mass. Based on the analysis presented, we\nconclude that [VMF 98] 097 is a perturbed cluster with at least two\nsubstructures in velocity space and with other nearby structures at projected\ndistances of about 1 h^-1 Mpc. This cluster is an example of a poor cluster\ncaught in the process of accreting sub-structures to become a rich cluster.\n"

    "abstract": "  Context:A significant fraction of progenitors for long gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) are believed to be massive stars. The investigation of long GRBs\ntherefore requires modeling the propagation of ultra-relativistic blastwaves\nthrough the circumburst medium surrounding massive stars. We simulate the\nexpansion of an isotropic, adiabatic relativistic fireball into the wind-shaped\nmedium around a massive GRB progenitor. The circumburst medium is composed of a\nrealistically stratified stellar wind zone up to its termination shock,\nfollowed by a region of shocked wind characterized by a constant density. Aims:\nWe followed the evolution of the blastwave through all its stages, including\nthe extremely rapid acceleration up to a Lorentz factor 75 flow, its\ndeceleration by interaction with stellar wind, its passage of the wind\ntermination shock, until its propagation through shocked wind. Methods: We used\nthe adaptive mesh refinement versatile advection code to follow the evolution\nof the fireball. Results: We show that the acceleration from purely thermal to\nultra-relativistic kinetic regimes is abrupt and produces an internally\nstructured blastwave. We resolved the structure of this ultra-relativistic\nshell in all stages, thanks to the adaptive mesh. We comment on the dynamical\nroles played by forward and reverse shock pairs in the phase of interaction\nwith the free stellar wind and clearly identify the complex shock-dominated\nstructure created when the shell crosses the terminal shock. Conclusion: We\nshow that in our model where the terminal shock is taken relatively close to\nthe massive star, the phase of self-similar deceleration of Blandford-McKee\ntype can only be produced in the constant density, shocked wind zone.\n"

    "title": "Is diversity good?",
    "abstract": "  Prominent ethical and policy issues such as affirmative action and female\nenrollment in science and engineering revolve around the idea that diversity is\ngood. However, even though diversity is an ambiguous concept, a precise\ndefinition is seldom provided. We show that diversity may be construed as a\nfactual description, a craving for symmetry, an intrinsic good, an instrumental\ngood, a symptom, or a side effect. These acceptions differ vastly in their\nnature and properties. The first one cannot lead to any action and the second\none is mistaken. Diversity as intrinsic good is a mere opinion, which cannot be\nconcretely applied; moreover, the most commonly invoked forms of diversity\n(sexual and racial) are not intrinsically good. On the other hand, diversity as\ninstrumental good can be evaluated empirically and can give rise to policies,\nbut these may be very weak. Finally, symptoms and side effects are not actually\nabout diversity. We consider the example of female enrollment in science and\nengineering, interpreting the various arguments found in the literature in\nlight of this polysemy.\n  Keywords: ethics, policy, higher education, female students, minority\nstudents, affirmative action\n"

Such skew-symmetric forms (which were\nnamed evolutionary ones since they possess evolutionary properties), as well as\nthe closed exterior forms, describe the conservation laws. But in contrast to\nexterior forms, which describe conservation laws for physical fields, the\nevolutionary forms correspond to conservation laws for material systems.\n  The evolutionary forms possess an unique peculiarity, namely, the closed\nexterior forms are obtained from these forms. It is just this that enables one\nto describe the process of generation of physical fields, to disclose\nconnection between physical fields and material systems and to resolve many\nproblems of existing field theories.\n"

    "title": "Physical Layer Network Coding",
    "abstract": "  A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with a wired\nnetwork is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted by a node may\nreach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals from several other\nnodes simultaneously. Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as\nan interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE\n802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at\nthe physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting\nadvantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a\nphysical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among\nnodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding\narithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use\nof the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves\nfor equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve\n100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and\nstraightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. More\nspecifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double that\nof traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higher\nthan 0dB). We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based\nnetwork coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for\nboosting network capacity.\n"

This\ndoubly anisotropic superfluid, when it is confined in aerogel, represents the\nmost interesting example of a system with continuous symmetry in the presence\nof random anisotropy disorder. We discuss the Larkin-Imry-Ma state, which is\ncharacterized by the short-range orientational order of the vector l, while the\nlong-range orientational order is destroyed by the collective action of the\nrandomly oriented aerogel strings. On the other hand, sufficiently large\nregular anisotropy produced either by the deformation of the aerogel or by\napplied superflow suppresses the Larkin-Imry-Ma effect leading to the uniform\norientation of the vector l. This interplay of regular and random anisotropy\nallows us to study many different effects.\n"

    "abstract": "  We study the interplay of Klein tunneling (= interband tunneling) between\nn-doped and p-doped regions in graphene and Andreev reflection (= electron-hole\nconversion) at a superconducting electrode. The tunneling conductance of an\nn-p-n junction initially increases upon lowering the temperature, while the\ncoherence time of the electron-hole pairs is still less than their lifetime,\nbut then drops back again when the coherence time exceeds the lifetime. This\nreentrance effect, known from diffusive conductors and ballistic quantum dots,\nprovides a method to detect phase coherent Klein tunneling of electron-hole\npairs.\n"

    "abstract": "  Mammoths lived in Arctic East Siberia. In this region there is not sufficient\nsunlight over the year for the growth of the plants on which these animals\nfeed. Therefore the latitude of this region was lower before the end of the\nPleistocene. As the cause of this geographic pole shift, we postulate a massive\nobject, which moved in an extremely eccentric orbit and was hot from tidal work\nand solar radiation. Evaporation produced a disk-shaped cloud of ions around\nthe Sun. This cloud partially shielded the solar radiation, producing the cold\nand warm periods that characterize the Pleistocene. The shielding depends on\nthe inclination of Earth's orbit, which has a period of 100'000 years. The\ncloud builds up to a density at which inelastic particle collisions induce its\ncollapse The resulting near-periodic time dependence resembles that of\nDansgaard-Oeschger events. During cold periods fine grained inclusions were\ndeposited into the ice. The Pleistocene ended when the massive object had a\nclose encounter with the Earth, which suffered a one per mil stretching\ndeformation. While the deformation relaxed to an equilibrium shape in one to\nseveral years, the globe turned relative to the rotation axis: The North Pole\nmoved from Greenland to the Arctic Sea. The massive object was torn to pieces,\nwhich evaporated.\n"

We find that stellar-mass black\nholes, formed in the supernova explosions of the most massive cluster stars,\ncan constitute a dynamically important population. If a significant number of\nblack holes are retained (here we assume complete retention), these objects\nrapidly form a dense core where interactions are common, resulting in the\nscattering of black holes into the cluster halo, and the ejection of black\nholes from the cluster. These two processes heat the stellar component,\nresulting in prolonged core expansion of a magnitude matching the observations.\nSignificant core evolution is also observed in Magellanic Cloud clusters at\nearly times. We find that this does not result from the action of black holes,\nbut can be reproduced by the effects of mass-loss due to rapid stellar\nevolution in a primordially mass segregated cluster.\n"

To do this we consider a model\nsystem that consists of a SMM embedded in the nonmagnetic barrier of a magnetic\ntunnel junction. The anisotropy axis of the SMM forms an arbitrary angle with\nmagnetic moments of the leads (the latter ones are assumed to be collinear).\nThe reversal of the SMM's spin takes place due to exchange interaction between\nthe molecule and electrons tunneling through the barrier. The current flowing\nthrough the system as well as the average z-component of the SMM's spin are\ncalculated in the second-order perturbation description (Fermi golden rule).\n"

    "abstract": "  The threshold electrodisintegration of the deuteron at backward angles is\nstudied with a relativistic Hamiltonian, including a relativistic\none-pion-exchange potential (OPEP) with off-shell terms as predicted by\npseudovector coupling of pions to nucleons. The bound and scattering states are\nobtained in the center-of-mass frame, and then boosted from it to the Breit\nframe, where the evaluation of the relevant matrix elements of the\nelectromagnetic current operator is carried out. The latter includes, in\naddition to one-body, also two-body terms due to pion exchange, as obtained,\nconsistently with the OPEP, in pseudovector pion-nucleon coupling theory. The\nfull Lorentz structure of these currents is retained. In order to estimate the\nmagnitude of the relativistic effects we perform, for comparison, the\ncalculation with a non-relativistic phase-equivalent Hamiltonian and the\nstandard non-relativistic expressions for the one-body and two-body\npion-exchange currents. Our results for the electrodisintegration cross section\nshow that, in the calculations using one-body currents, relativistic\ncorrections become significant ({\\it i.e.},, larger than 10%) only at high\nmomentum transfer $Q$ ($Q^2 \\simeq 40$fm$^{-2},$ and beyond). However, the\ninclusion of two-body currents makes the relativistic predictions considerably\nsmaller than the corresponding non-relativistic results in the $Q^2$ region\n(18--40) fm$^{-2},$. The calculations based on the relativistic model also\nconfirm the inadequacy, already established in a non-relativistic context, of\nthe present electromagnetic current model to reproduce accurately the\nexperimental data at intermediate values of momentum transfers.\n"

The potential to\ndiscovery a deviation from Standard Model expectations with the first few\n${fb},^{-1},$ of LHC data was studied using the parametrized simulation of the\nATLAS detector. Several signatures were considered, involving hard jets, large\nmissing energy, and either $b$-tagged jets, opposite-sign isolated electron or\nmuon pairs, or top quarks reconstructed exploiting their fully hadronic decays.\nWith only 1 ${fb},^{-1},$ of data each of these signatures may allow to observe\nan excess of events over Standard Model expectation with a statistical\nsignificance exceeding 5 standard deviations. An analytical expression was\nderived for the shape of the distribution of the dilepton invariant mass\narising from the three-body leptonic decay of the neutralinos under the\nhypothesis of heavy scalars, which is appropriate for the focus-point scenario.\nThe resulting function was used to fit the distribution of the dilepton\ninvariant mass obtained with simulated LHC data, and to extract the value of\ntwo kinematic endpoints measuring the $\\tilde \\chi^0_2 - \\tilde \\chi^0_1$ and\nthe $\\tilde \\chi^0_3 - \\tilde \\chi^0_1$ mass differences. This information was\nused to constrain the MSSM parameter space compatible with the data.\n"

Groups of central type play a fundamental role in the\nclassification of semisimple triangular complex Hopf algebras and can be\ndetermined by their representation theoretical properties.\n  Suppose that a finite group $Q$ acts on an abelian group $A$ so that there\nexists a bijective 1-cocycle $\\pi\\in Z^1(Q,\\ach)$, where\n$\\ach=\\rm{Hom},(A,\\C^*)$ is endowed with the diagonal $Q$-action.

Hence, the semidirect\nproduct $G$ is of central type.\n  In this paper we present a more general correspondence between bijective and\nnon-degenerate cohomology classes. In particular, given a bijective class\n$[\\pi]\\in H^1(Q,\\ach)$ as above, we construct non-degenerate classes\n$[c_{\\pi},]\\in H^2(G,\\C^*)$ for certain extensions $1\\to A\\to G\\to Q\\to 1$ which\nare not necessarily split.

General\nconditions relating the diffusive nature of the process to the temporal\nexponent of the Lagrangian velocity correlation (in Corrsin approximation) are\nderived.\n"

    "abstract": "  We investigate the origin of the GRB 060912A, which has observational\nproperties that make its classification as either a long or short burst\nambiguous. Short duration GRBs (SGRBs) are thought to have typically lower\nenergies than long duration bursts, can be found in galaxies with populations\nof all ages and are likely to originate from different progenitors to the long\nduration bursts. However, it has become clear that duration alone is\ninsufficient to make a distinction between the two populations in many cases,\nleading to a desire to find additional discriminators of burst type. GRB\n060912A had a duration of 6 s and occurred only ~10 arcsec from a bright, low\nredshift ($z=0.0936$) elliptical galaxy, suggesting that this may have been the\nhost, which would favour it being a short-burst. However, our deep optical\nimaging and spectroscopy of the location of GRB 060912A using the VLT shows\nthat GRB 060912A more likely originates in a distant star forming galaxy at\nz=0.937, and is most likely a long burst. This demonstrates the risk in\nidentifying bright, nearby galaxies as the hosts of given GRBs without further\nsupporting evidence. Further, it implies that, in the absence of secure\nidentifications, \"host\" type, or more broadly discriminators which rely on\ngalaxy redshifts, may not be good indicators of the true nature of any given\nGRB.\n"

    "title": "An experimental test of non-local realism",
    "abstract": "  Most working scientists hold fast to the concept of 'realism' - a viewpoint\naccording to which an external reality exists independent of observation. But\nquantum physics has shattered some of our cornerstone beliefs. According to\nBell's theorem, any theory that is based on the joint assumption of realism and\nlocality (meaning that local events cannot be affected by actions in space-like\nseparated regions) is at variance with certain quantum predictions. Experiments\nwith entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum\npredictions, thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining\nrealism as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction\nof 'spooky' actions that defy locality. Here we show by both theory and\nexperiment that a broad and rather reasonable class of such non-local realistic\ntheories is incompatible with experimentally observable quantum correlations.\nIn the experiment, we measure previously untested correlations between two\nentangled photons, and show that these correlations violate an inequality\nproposed by Leggett for non-local realistic theories. Our result suggests that\ngiving up the concept of locality is not sufficient to be consistent with\nquantum experiments, unless certain intuitive features of realism are\nabandoned.\n"

    "abstract": "  Water molecules play a fundamental role in the physics of slow crack\npropagation in glasses. It is commonly understood that, during\nstress-corrosion, water molecules that move in the crack cavity effectively\nreduce the bond strength at the strained crack tip and, thus, support crack\npropagation. Yet the details of the environmental condition at the crack tip in\nmoist air are not well determined. In a previous work, we reported direct\nevidence of the presence of a 100 nm long liquid condensate at the crack tip in\nfused silica glass during very slow crack propagation (10^-9 to 10^-10 m/s).\nThese observations are based on in-situ AFM phase imaging techniques applied on\nDCDC glass specimens in controlled atmosphere. Here, we discuss the physical\norigin of the AFM phase contrast between the liquid condensate and the glass\nsurface in relation to tip-sample adhesion induced by capillary bridges. We\nthen report new experimental data on the water condensation length increase\nwith relative humidity in the atmosphere. The measured condensation lengths\nwere much larger than what predicted using the Kelvin equation and expected\ngeometry of the crack tip.\n"

    "abstract": "  Recent three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations of\nprotoplanetary disks report disparate disk behaviors, and these differences\ninvolve the importance of convection to disk cooling, the dependence of disk\ncooling on metallicity, and the stability of disks against fragmentation and\nclump formation. To guarantee trustworthy results, a radiative physics\nalgorithm must demonstrate the capability to handle both the high and low\noptical depth regimes. We develop a test suite that can be used to demonstrate\nan algorithm's ability to relax to known analytic flux and temperature\ndistributions, to follow a contracting slab, and to inhibit or permit\nconvection appropriately. We then show that the radiative algorithm employed by\nMeji\\'a (2004) and Boley et al. (2006) and the algorithm employed by Cai et al.\n(2006) and Cai et al. (2007, in prep.) pass these tests with reasonable\naccuracy. In addition, we discuss a new algorithm that couples flux-limited\ndiffusion with vertical rays, we apply the test suite, and we discuss the\nresults of evolving the Boley et al. (2006) disk with this new routine.\nAlthough the outcome is significantly different in detail with the new\nalgorithm, we obtain the same qualitative answers. Our disk does not cool fast\ndue to convection, and it is stable to fragmentation. We find an effective\n$\\alpha\\approx 10^{-2},$. In addition, transport is dominated by low-order\nmodes.\n"

We also produce realistic mock\nobservations to verify whether the results from hydrodynamic simulations can be\nconfirmed. We find that SZ profiles depend marginally on the modelled physical\nprocesses, while they exhibit a strong dependence on cluster mass. The central\nand total SZ emission strongly correlate with the cluster X-ray luminosity and\ntemperature. The logarithmic slopes of these scaling relations differ from the\nself-similar predictions by less than 0.2; the normalization of the relations\nis lower for simulations including radiative cooling. The observational test\nsuggests that SZ cluster profiles are unlikely to be able to probe the ICM\nphysics. The total SZ decrement appears to be an observable much more robust\nthan the central intensity, and we suggest using the former to investigate\nscaling relations.\n"

We investigate a scenario in which substructures consist\nof $\\sim 100$ \"mini-spikes\" around intermediate-mass black holes. Focusing on\nprimary positrons and antiprotons, we find large boost factors, up to a few\nthousand, that exhibit a large variance at high energy in the case of positrons\nand at low energy in the case of antiprotons.

Independent determinations of w(\\theta) as a\nfunction of magnitude limit are presented for both the HST ACS catalog and also\nfor the ground-based data from Subaru and the CFHT. Despite having\nsignificantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. At bright\nmagnitudes (IAB<22), our data generally match very well with existing\nmeasurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formation\ncalculations of Kitzbichler and White from the Millennium Simulation. The\nexception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmic\nvariance scatter for \\theta > 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularly\nrich structure known to exist at z~0.8. For fainter samples, however, the level\nof clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in all\nthree catalogues we find w(\\theta=1')~0.014 at a median IAB magnitude of 24. At\nthese very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latest\ndeterminations from the Canada-France Legacy Survey. This level of clustering\nis approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at all\nangles). The semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, which\nis too small to account for the discrepancy. We therefore conclude that the\nmean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.\n"

The differences between this wind model and previous\nPrimakoff-type simulations are described. A more complex structure, even in 1D,\nis revealed through the presence of both forward and reverse shocks, with a\nseparating contact discontinuity. The effects of radiative cooling are\ninvestigated and key outburst parameters such as mass-loss rate, ejecta\nvelocity and mass are varied. The shock velocities as a function of time are\ncompared to the ones derived in Paper I. We show how the manner in which the\nmatter is ejected controls the evolution of the shock and that for a\nwell-cooled remnant, the shock deceleration rate depends on the amount of\nenergy that is radiated away.\n"

    "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a novel inference method for dynamic genetic\nnetworks which makes it possible to face with a number of time measurements n\nmuch smaller than the number of genes p. The approach is based on the concept\nof low order conditional dependence graph that we extend here in the case of\nDynamic Bayesian Networks. Most of our results are based on the theory of\ngraphical models associated with the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). In this\nway, we define a minimal DAG G which describes exactly the full order\nconditional dependencies given the past of the process. Then, to face with the\nlarge p and small n estimation case, we propose to approximate DAG G by\nconsidering low order conditional independencies. We introduce partial qth\norder conditional dependence DAGs G(q) and analyze their probabilistic\nproperties. In general, DAGs G(q) differ from DAG G but still reflect relevant\ndependence facts for sparse networks such as genetic networks. By using this\napproximation, we set out a non-bayesian inference method and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach on both simulated and real data analysis. The\ninference procedure is implemented in the R package 'G1DBN' freely available\nfrom the CRAN archive.\n"

There is indeed no scale to stop the blue-shifting effect\nencountered in the backward propagation towards the event horizon. On the\ncontrary, when taking into account the gravitational interactions neglected in\nthe semi-classical treatment, a UV scale stopping the blue-shift could be\ndynamically engendered. To show that this is the case, we use a\nnon-perturbative treatment based on the large-N limit, where $N$ is the number\nof matter fields. In this limit, the semi-classical treatment is the leading\ncontribution. Non-linear gravitational effects appear in the next orders and in\nthe first of these, the effects are governed by the two-point correlation\nfunction of the energy-momentum tensor evaluated in the vacuum. Taking this\ncorrelator into account, backward propagated modes are dissipated at a distance\nfrom the horizon $\\propto G\\kappa$ when measured in a freely falling frame.\n($G$ is Newton's constant and $\\kappa$ the surface gravity.) This result can be\nalso obtained by considering light propagation in a stochastic ensemble of\nmetrics whose fluctuations are determined by the above correlator.\n"

    "abstract": "  We considered diffusion-driven processes on small-world networks with\ndistance-dependent random links. The study of diffusion on such networks is\nmotivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronization\nproblems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport on\nnetworks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a rich\nphase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context of\nrandom walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:\nin the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and\nin the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the\nmotion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that\nin a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density\nof, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction\ntopology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some\ncases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in the\nEdwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. This\nbreak-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where\nthe mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a\nnaive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are also\nconfirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of the\nnetwork Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework for\nthe relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finite\nnetworks. This work provides a detailed account of the\nself-consistent-perturbative and renormalization approaches briefly introduced\nin two earlier short reports.\n"

P. 36 (2005) 275-290) we\nhave addressed the mechanical foundations of equilibrium thermodynamics on the\nbasis of the Generalized Helmholtz Theorem. It was found that the volume\nentropy provides a good mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy because it\nsatisfies the heat theorem and it is an adiabatic invariant. This property\nexplains the ``equal'' sign in Clausius principle ($S_f \\geq S_i$) in a purely\nmechanical way and suggests that the volume entropy might explain the ``larger\nthan'' sign (i.e. the Law of Entropy Increase) if non adiabatic transformations\nwere considered. Based on the principles of microscopic (quantum or classical)\nmechanics here we prove that, provided the initial equilibrium satisfy the\nnatural condition of decreasing ordering of probabilities, the expectation\nvalue of the volume entropy cannot decrease for arbitrary transformations\nperformed by some external sources of work on a insulated system. This can be\nregarded as a rigorous quantum mechanical proof of the Second Law. We discuss\nhow this result relates to the Minimal Work Principle and improves over\nprevious attempts. The natural evolution of entropy is towards larger values\nbecause the natural state of matter is at positive temperature. Actually the\nLaw of Entropy Decrease holds in artificially prepared negative temperature\nsystems.\n"

    "abstract": "  It has been speculated that quantum gravity might induce a \"foamy\" space-time\nstructure at small scales, randomly perturbing the propagation phases of\nfree-streaming particles (such as kaons, neutrons, or neutrinos). Particle\ninterferometry might then reveal non-standard decoherence effects, in addition\nto standard ones (due to, e.g., finite source size and detector resolution.) In\nthis work we discuss the phenomenology of such non-standard effects in the\npropagation of electron neutrinos in the Sun and in the long-baseline reactor\nexperiment KamLAND, which jointly provide us with the best available probes of\ndecoherence at neutrino energies E ~ few MeV. In the solar neutrino case, by\nmeans of a perturbative approach, decoherence is shown to modify the standard\n(adiabatic) propagation in matter through a calculable damping factor. By\nassuming a power-law dependence of decoherence effects in the energy domain\n(E^n with n = 0,+/-1,+/-2), theoretical predictions for two-family neutrino\nmixing are compared with the data and discussed. We find that neither solar nor\nKamLAND data show evidence in favor of non-standard decoherence effects, whose\ncharacteristic parameter gamma_0 can thus be significantly constrained. In the\n\"Lorentz-invariant\" case n=-1, we obtain the upper limit gamma_0<0.78 x 10^-26\nGeV at 95% C.L. In the specific case n=-2, the constraints can also be\ninterpreted as bounds on possible matter density fluctuations in the Sun, which\nwe improve by a factor of ~ 2 with respect to previous analyses.\n"

    "abstract": "  Clumping in the winds of massive stars may significantly reduce empirical\nmass-loss rates, and which in turn may have a large impact on our understanding\nof massive star evolution. Here, we investigate wind-clumping through the\nlinear polarization induced by light scattering off the clumps. Through the use\nof an analytic wind clumping model, we predict the time evolution of the linear\npolarimetry over a large parameter space. We concentrate on the Luminous Blue\nVariables, which display the greatest amount of polarimetric variability and\nfor which we recently conducted a spectropolarimetric survey. Our model results\nindicate that the observed level of polarimetric variability can be reproduced\nfor two regimes of parameter space: one of a small number of massive,\noptically-thick clumps; and one of a very large number of low-mass clumps.\nAlthough a systematic time-resolved monitoring campaign is required to\ndistinguish between the two scenarios, we currently favour the latter, given\nthe short timescale of the observed polarization variability. As the\npolarization is predicted to scale linearly with mass-loss rate, we anticipate\nthat all hot stars with very large mass-loss rates should display polarimetric\nvariability. This is consistent with recent findings that intrinsic\npolarization is more common in stars with strong H$\\alpha$ emission.\n"

    "title": "Extraction of Freshwater and Energy from Atmosphere",
    "abstract": "  Author offers and researches a new, cheap method for the extraction of\nfreshwater from the Earth atmosphere. The suggected method is fundamentally\ndictinct from all existing methods that extract freshwater from air. All other\nindustrial methods extract water from a saline water source (in most cases from\nseawater). This new method may be used at any point in the Earth except Polar\nZones. It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawater\nis not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method is\nvery environment-friendly. The author method has two working versions: (1) the\nfirst variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube\nin a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in\nthe second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface.\nIn the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air\nflow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.\n  The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount.\nMoreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (>30 or more atm.)\nand can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that way\nthe freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater is\ninjected into air and solar air heater may be used. The solar air heater\nproduces a huge amount of electricity as a very powerful electricity generation\nplant. The offered electricity installation in 100 - 200 times cheaper than any\ncommon electric plant of equivalent output.\n  Key words: Extraction freshwater, method of getting freshwater, receiving\nenergy from atmosphere, powerful renewal electric plant.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present estimates of the N-point galaxy, area-averaged, angular\ncorrelation functions $\\bar{\\omega},_{N},$($\\theta$) for $N$ = 2,...,7 for\ngalaxies from the fifth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our\nparent sample is selected from galaxies with $18 \\leq r < 21$, and is the\nlargest ever used to study higher-order correlations. We subdivide this parent\nsample into two volume limited samples using photometric redshifts, and these\ntwo samples are further subdivided by magnitude, redshift, and color (producing\nearly- and late-type galaxy samples) to determine the dependence of\n$\\bar{\\omega},_{N},$($\\theta$) on luminosity, redshift, and galaxy-type. We\nmeasure $\\bar{\\omega},_{N},$($\\theta$) using oversampling techniques and use them\nto calculate the projected, $s_{N},$. Using models derived from theoretical\npower-spectra and perturbation theory, we measure the bias parameters $b_1$ and\n$c_2$, finding that the large differences in both bias parameters ($b_1$ and\n$c_2$) between early- and late-type galaxies are robust against changes in\nredshift, luminosity, and $\\sigma_8$, and that both terms are consistently\nsmaller for late-type galaxies. By directly comparing their higher-order\ncorrelation measurements, we find large differences in the clustering of\nlate-type galaxies at redshifts lower than 0.3 and those at redshifts higher\nthan 0.3, both at large scales ($c_2$ is larger by $\\sim0.5$ at $z > 0.3$) and\nsmall scales (large amplitudes are measured at small scales only for $z > 0.3$,\nsuggesting much more merger driven star formation at $z > 0.3$). Finally, our\nmeasurements of $c_2$ suggest both that $\\sigma_8 < 0.8$ and $c_2$ is negative.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present Gemini optical spectroscopy of 23 young star clusters in NGC3256.\nWe find that the cluster ages range are from few Myr to ~150 Myr. All these\nclusters are relatively massive (2--40)x 10^{5}, \\msun$ and appear to be of\nroughly 1.5 \\zo metallicity. The majority of the clusters in our sample follow\nthe same rotation curve as the gas and hence were presumably formed in the\nmolecular-gas disk. However, a western subsample of five clusters has\nvelocities that deviate significantly from the gas rotation curve. These\nclusters may either belong to the second spiral galaxy of the merger or may\nhave formed in tidal-tail gas falling back into the system. We discuss our\nobservations in light of other known cluster populations in merging galaxies,\nand suggest that NGC 3256 is similar to Arp 220, and hence may become an\nUltra-luminous Infrared Galaxy as the merger progresses and the star-formation\nrate increases.\n  Some of the clusters which appeared as isolated in our ground-based images\nare clearly resolved into multiple sub-components in the HST-ACS images. The\nsame effect has been observed in the Antennae galaxies, showing that clusters\nare often not formed in isolation, but instead tend to form in larger groups or\ncluster complexes.\n"

The resistivity has an unusually strong magnetic field\ndependence for a paramagnetic metal. The 20 mK resistivity increases by 75%\nbetween H=0 and 4 T and then decreases by 65% between 4 T and 18 T. Similarly,\nthe $A$ coefficient increases with the field from -77 to 29$\n\\mu\\Omega$cmK$^{-2},$ between H=0 and 7 T and then decreases to 18$\n\\mu\\Omega$cmK$^{-2},$ for 18 T. This nontrivial temperature and field variation\nis attributed to the existence of a very narrow Kondo-hole band in the\nhybridization gap, which pins the Fermi energy. Due to disorder the Kondo-hole\nband has localized states close to the band edges. The resistivity for $x=0.1$\nhas a qualitatively similar behavior to that of $x=0.02$, but with a larger\nKondo-hole band.\n"

The method can be applied, for example, for 100 nm\nthin high-T_c films grown on insulator substrate 10 mm X 10 mm. In Corbino\ngeometry two Ohmic contacts have to be made on the film evaporating Ag or using\nsilver paste: one circle with radius r_a (1) and a ring electrode with internal\nradius r_b (2). In the in-between space (r_a,r_b) a ring electrode from mylar\nassures a capacitive connection between the superconducting layer and the\nmetallized surface (3) of the mylar. In such a way we have an field effect\ntransistor (FET) type structure with a circular gate. When at low enough\ntemperatures T << T_c an AC current with frequency omega is applied between the\ncircle source (1) and the ring-shaped drain (2) an AC Bernoulli voltage with\ndouble frequency 2f appears between the gate (3) and the source (1). The 2f\nsignal depends on Cooper pair effective mass and its systematic investigation\ngives a Cooper pair mass spectroscopy. In the normal phase 2f gives logarithmic\nderivative of the density of states (DOS) with respect of Fermi energy.\nApplying a gate voltage in the same structure gives the mobility of the normal\nphase.\n"

The material content\nconsists of two fluids: radiation and Chaplygin gas. The quantization of these\nmodels is made by following the Wheeler and DeWitt's prescriptions. Using the\nSchutz formalism, the time notion is recovered and the Wheeler-DeWitt equation\ntransforms into a time dependent Schr\\\"{o},dinger equation, which rules the\ndynamics of the early universe, under the action of an effective potential\n$V_{ef},$. Using a finite differences method and the Crank-Nicholson scheme, in\na code implemented in the program OCTAVE, we solve the corresponding time\ndependent Schr\\\"{o},dinger equation and obtain the time evolution of a initial\nwave packet. This wave packet satisfies appropriate boundary conditions. The\ncalculation of the tunneling probabilities shows that the universe may emerge\nfrom the Planck era to an inflationary phase. It also shows that, the tunneling\nprobability is a function of the mean energy of the initial wave packet and of\ntwo parameters related to the Chaplygin gas.

Over ten years worth of data are gathered together to show\nthat the periodic X-ray outbursts are dependant on both the binary motion and\nthe size of the circumstellar disk. In the first instance an accurate orbital\nsolution is determined from pulse periods, and in the second case the strength\nand shape of the Halpha emission line is shown to be a valuable indicator of\ndisk size and its behaviour. Furthermore, the shape of the emission line\npermits a direct determination of the disk size which is in good agreement with\ntheoretical estimates. A detailed study of the pulse period variations during\noutbursts determined the binary period to be 247.8, in good agreement with the\nperiod determined from the recurrence of the outbursts.\n"

    "abstract": "  We use a series of N-body simulations of the LCDM cosmology to investigate\nthe redshift evolution since z=1 of the properties and alignment with the\nlarge-scale structure of haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids. We\nfind that: (i) Once a rescaling of the halo mass with M*, the mass scale\ncollapsing at redshift z, is performed, there is no further significant\nredshift dependence in the halo properties; (ii) The environment influences\nhalo shape and formation time at all investigated redshifts for haloes with\nmasses M<M*; and (iii) There is a significant alignment of both spin and shape\nof haloes with filaments and sheets. In detail, at all redshifts up to z=1: a)\nHaloes with M<M* tend to be more oblate when located in clusters than in the\nother environments; this trend is reversed at higher masses: above about M*,\nhalos in clusters are typically more prolate than similar massive haloes in\nsheets, filaments and voids. b) Haloes with M>M* in filaments spin more rapidly\nthan similar mass haloes in clusters; haloes in voids have the lowest median\nspin parameters; c) Haloes with M<M* tend to be younger in voids and older in\nclusters; d) In sheets, halo spin vectors tend to lie within the sheet plane\nindependent of mass; in filaments, instead, haloes with M<M* tend to spin\nparallel to the filament and haloes with M>M* perpendicular to it. For masses\nM>M*, the major axis of haloes in filaments and sheets is strongly aligned with\nthe filament or the sheet. Such halo-LSS alignments may be of importance in\nweak lensing analyses of cosmic shear. A question that is opened by our study\nis why, in the 0 < z < 1 redshift regime that we have investigated, the mass\nscale M* sets roughly the threshold below which the LSS-environment either\nbegins to affect, or reverses, the properties of dark matter haloes.\n"

Such a lockin has been predicted as a key part of the Landau CDW theory\nof the stripe phase. Thus it is possible to constrain the size of the\nelectron-phonon coupling in the CDW Landau theory to between 0.04% and 0.05% of\nthe electron-electron coupling term. In the thin film samples, films of the\nsame thickness grown on two different substrates exhibited different\nwavevectors. The different strains present in the films on the two substrates\ncan be related to the wavevector observed via Landau theory. It is demonstrated\nthat the the elastic term which favours an incommensurate modulation has a\nsimilar size to the coupling between the strain and the wavevector, meaning\nthat the coupling of strain to the superlattice is unexpectedly strong.\n"

    "abstract": "  The cycling operation is a special kind of conjugation that can be applied to\nelements in Artin's braid groups, in order to reduce their length. It is a key\ningredient of the usual solutions to the conjugacy problem in braid groups. In\ntheir seminal paper on braid-cryptography, Ko, Lee et al. proposed the {\\it\ncycling problem}, as a hard problem in braid groups that could be interesting\nfor cryptography. In this paper we give a polynomial solution to that problem,\nmainly by showing that cycling is surjective, and using a result by Maffre\nwhich shows that pre-images under cycling can be computed fast. This result\nalso holds in every Artin-Tits group of spherical type.\n  On the other hand, the conjugacy search problem in braid groups is usually\nsolved by computing some finite sets called (left) ultra summit sets\n(left-USS), using left normal forms of braids. But one can equally use right\nnormal forms and compute right-USS's. Hard instances of the conjugacy search\nproblem correspond to elements having big (left and right) USS's. One may think\nthat even if some element has a big left-USS, it could possibly have a small\nright-USS. We show that this is not the case in the important particular case\nof rigid braids. More precisely, we show that the left-USS and the right-USS of\na given rigid braid determine isomorphic graphs, with the arrows reversed, the\nisomorphism being defined using iterated cycling. We conjecture that the same\nis true for every element, not necessarily rigid, in braid groups and\nArtin-Tits groups of spherical type.\n"

We find\nthat fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. Exponential\ndisks are well fit with Sersic models and have small measurement errors,\nwhereas fits to de Vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to the\nlarge amount of light at large radii. We find that both codes provide reliable\nfits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness is\nabove that of the sky. Moreover, both codes return errors that significantly\nunderestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated with\nsimulations. We find that GIM2D suffers significant systematic errors for\nspheroids with close companions owing to the difficulty of effectively masking\nout neighboring galaxy light; there appears to be no work around to this\nimportant systematic in GIM2D's current implementation. While this crowding\nerror affects only a small fraction of galaxies in GEMS, it must be accounted\nfor in the analysis of deeper cosmological images or of more crowded fields\nwith GIM2D. In contrast, GALFIT results are robust to the presence of neighbors\nbecause it can simultaneously fit the profiles of multiple companions thereby\ndeblending their effect on the fit to the galaxy of interest. We find GALFIT's\nrobustness to nearby companions and factor of >~20 faster runtime speed are\nimportant advantages over GIM2D for analyzing large HST/ACS datasets. Finally\nwe include our final catalog of fit results for all 41,495 objects detected in\nGEMS.\n"

This analysis is explored over a wide range of density, radiation field,\nextinction, and other relevant parameters.

For the conventional\nCO(1-0) transition, the computed conversion factor varies significantly below\nand above the canonical value for the Milky Way in the four galaxy types\nconsidered.

While the number of subhalos depends weakly on the formation\ntime, the slope of the halo substructure velocity function does not.

We find two distinct regions-of-interest: the standard Concordance\nModel, and a region with large values of omega_DM, omega_B and H_0. This second\npeak in parameter space can be rejected by applying a constraint (or a prior)\non the allowable values of the Hubble constant. Our new technique uses a\nnon-parametric fit to the data, along with a frequentist approach and a smart\nsearch algorithm to map out a statistical confidence surface. The result is a\nconfidence ``ball'': a set of parameter values that contains the true value\nwith probability at least 1-alpha. Our algorithm performs a role similar to the\noften used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which samples from the posterior\nprobability function in order to provide Bayesian credible intervals on the\nparameters.

    "abstract": "  Recently H(z) data obtained from differential ages of galaxies have been\nproposed as a new geometrical probe of dark energy. In this paper we use those\ndata, combined with other background tests (CMB shift and SNIa data), to\nconstrain a set of general relativistic dark energy models together with some\nother models motivated by extra dimensions. Our analysis rests mostly on\nBayesian statistics, and we conclude that LCDM is at least substantially\nfavoured, and that braneworld models are less favoured than general\nrelativistic ones.\n"

    "abstract": "  We present the first results from a new generation of simulated large sky\ncoverage (~100 square degrees) Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) cluster surveys\nusing the cosmological adaptive mesh refinement N-body/hydro code Enzo. We have\nsimulated a very large (512^3h^{-3},Mpc^3) volume with unprecedented dynamic\nrange. We have generated simulated light cones to match the resolution and\nsensitivity of current and future SZE instruments. Unlike many previous studies\nof this type, our simulation includes unbound gas, where an appreciable\nfraction of the baryons in the universe reside.\n  We have found that cluster line-of-sight overlap may be a significant issue\nin upcoming single-dish SZE surveys. Smaller beam surveys (~1 arcmin) have more\nthan one massive cluster within a beam diameter 5-10% of the time, and a larger\nbeam experiment like Planck has multiple clusters per beam 60% of the time. We\nexplore the contribution of unresolved halos and unbound gas to the SZE\nsignature at the maximum decrement. We find that there is a contribution from\ngas outside clusters of ~16% per object on average for upcoming surveys. This\nadds both bias and scatter to the deduced value of the integrated SZE, adding\ndifficulty in accurately calibrating a cluster Y-M relationship.\n  Finally, we find that in images where objects with M > 5x10^{13}, M_{\\odot},\nhave had their SZE signatures removed, roughly a third of the total SZE flux\nstill remains. This gas exists at least partially in the Warm Hot Intergalactic\nMedium (WHIM), and will possibly be detectable with the upcoming generation of\nSZE surveys.\n"

    "abstract": "  Active galactic nuclei, x-ray binaries, pulsars, and gamma-ray bursts are all\nbelieved to be powered by compact objects surrounded by relativistic plasma\nflows driving phenomena such as accretion, winds, and jets. These flows are\noften accurately modelled by the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\napproximation. Time-dependent numerical MHD simulations have proven to be\nespecially insightful, but one regime that remains difficult to simulate is\nwhen the energy scales (kinetic, thermal, magnetic) within the plasma become\ndisparate. We develop a numerical scheme that significantly improves the\naccuracy and robustness of the solution in this regime. We use a modified form\nof the WENO method to construct a finite-volume general relativistic\nhydrodynamics code called WHAM that converges at fifth order. We avoid (1)\nfield-by-field decomposition by adaptively reducing down to 2-point stencils\nnear discontinuities for a more accurate treatment of shocks, and (2) excessive\nreduction to low order stencils, as in the standard WENO formalism, by\nmaintaining high order accuracy in smooth monotonic flows. Our scheme performs\nthe proper surface integral of the fluxes, converts cell averaged conserved\nquantities to point conserved quantities before performing the reconstruction\nstep, and correctly averages all source terms. We demonstrate that the scheme\nis robust in strong shocks, very accurate in smooth flows, and maintains\naccuracy even when the energy scales in the flow are highly disparate.\n"

    "title": "Relativistic Effects in Extreme Mass Ratio Gravitational Wave Bursts",
    "abstract": "  Extreme mass ratio bursts (EMRBs) have been proposed as a possible source for\nfuture space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA). These events are characterized by\nlong-period, nearly-radial orbits of compact objects around a central massive\nblack hole. The gravitational radiation emitted during such events consists of\na short burst, corresponding to periapse passage, followed by a longer, silent\ninterval. In this paper we investigate the impact of including relativistic\ncorrections to the description of the compact object's trajectory via a\ngeodesic treatment, as well as including higher-order multipole corrections in\nthe waveform calculation. The degree to which the relativistic corrections are\nimportant depends on the EMRB's orbital parameters. We find that relativistic\nEMRBs (v_{max},},/c > 0.25) are not rare and actually account for approximately\nhalf of the events in our astrophysical model. The relativistic corrections\ntend to significantly change the waveform amplitude and phase relative to a\nNewtonian description, although some of this dephasing could be mimicked by\nparameter errors. The dephasing over several bursts could be of particular\nimportance not only to gravitational wave detection, but also to parameter\nestimation, since it is highly correlated to the spin of the massive black\nhole. Consequently, we postulate that if a relativistic EMRB is detected, such\ndephasing might be used to probe the relativistic character of the massive\nblack hole and obtain information about its spin.\n"

Our invariants and the Bauer-Furuta classes\nare directly comparable for 4-manifolds with $b_1=0$; they are equivalent when\n$b_1=0$ and $b_+>1$, but are finer in the case $b_1=0$, $b_+=1$ (they detect\nthe wall-crossing phenomena).\n  We study fundamental properties of the new invariants in a very general\nframework. In particular we prove a universal cohomotopy invariant jump formula\nand a multiplicative property.

The second one is a one-dimensional spin system with nearest\nneighbor interactions also under the influence of an external driving force.\nBoth systems show a dynamical scaling with domain formation. The statistical\nbehavior of these domains is compared with models based on the coalescing\nrandom walk and the interacting random walk. We find that the scaling domain\nsize distribution of the gas and the spin systems is well fitted by the Wigner\nsurmise, which lead us to explore a possible connection between these systems\nand the circular orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. However, the study of\nthe correlation function of the domain edges, show that the statistical\nbehavior of the domains in both gas and spin systems, is not completely well\ndescribed by circular orthogonal ensemble, nor it is by other models proposed\nsuch as the coalescing random walk and the interacting random walk.\nNevertheless, we find that a simple model of independent intervals describe\nmore closely the statistical behavior of the domains formed in these systems.\n"

The appearance of higher binding energy component (HBEC) in the\noxygen 1s core peak from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggests the\npresence of oxygen vacancies in these samples. The amount of oxygen during the\nsynthesis determines the vacancy concentration in the samples which is directly\nrelated to the magnetic behavior of the samples. The magnetic moment decreases\nwith oxygen vacancy concentration in the samples. Valence band measurements\nwere performed to study the electronic structure of both stoichometric and\nreduced TiO2. The analyses show the presence of Ti 3d band near the Fermi level\nin reduced TiO2 samples. These bands are otherwise empty in stoichiometric TiO2\nand reside in the conduction band which makes them unobservable by XPS.

    "abstract": "  We prove an existence theorem for gauge invariant $L^2$-normal neighborhoods\nof the reduction loci in the space ${\\cal A},_a(E)$ of oriented connections on a\nfixed Hermitian 2-bundle $E$. We use this to obtain results on the topology of\nthe moduli space ${\\cal B},_a(E)$ of (non-necessarily irreducible) oriented\nconnections, and to study the Donaldson $\\mu$-classes globally around the\nreduction loci. In this part of the article we use essentially the concept of\nharmonic section in a sphere bundle with respect to an Euclidean connection.\n  Second, we concentrate on moduli spaces of instantons on definite 4-manifolds\nwith arbitrary first Betti number. We prove strong generic regularity results\nwhich imply (for bundles with \"odd\" first Chern class) the existence of a\nconnected, dense open set of \"good\" metrics for which all the reductions in the\nUhlenbeck compactification of the moduli space are simultaneously regular.\nThese results can be used to define new Donaldson type invariants for definite\n4-manifolds. The idea behind this construction is to notice that, for a good\nmetric $g$, the geometry of the instanton moduli spaces around the reduction\nloci is always the same, independently of the choice of $g$. The connectedness\nof the space of good metrics is important, in order to prove that no\nwall-crossing phenomena (jumps of invariants) occur. Moreover, we notice that,\nfor low instanton numbers, the corresponding moduli spaces are a priori compact\nand contain no reductions at all so, in these cases, the existence of\nwell-defined Donaldson type invariants is obvious. The natural question is to\ndecide whether these new Donaldson type invariants yield essentially new\ndifferential topological information on the base manifold have, or have a\npurely topological nature.\n"

To\ninvestigate electron scattering properties in a graphene plane, we have created\na gate-tunable potential barrier within a single-layer graphene sheet. We\nreport measurements of electrical transport across this structure as the\ntunable barrier potential is swept through a range of heights. When the barrier\nis sufficiently strong to form a bipolar junctions (npn or pnp) within the\ngraphene sheet, the resistance across the barrier sharply increases. We compare\nthese results to predictions for both diffusive and ballistic transport, as the\nbarrier rises on a length scale comparable to the mean free path. Finally, we\nshow how a magnetic field modifies transport across the barrier.\n"

The Schroedinger equation is solved by\nadiabatic expansion, using the conventional adiabatic approximation as a\nstarting point, and re-inserting the result into the Schroedinger equation to\nyield a second order correction. Closed expressions for arbitrary pulse shapes\nand diffraction orders are obtained and the losses of the population to output\nstates otherwise forbidden by the Bragg condition are derived. We consider the\nphase shift due to couplings of the desired output to these states that depends\non the interaction strength and duration and show how these can be kept\nnegligible by a choice of smooth (e.g., Gaussian) envelope functions even in\nsituations that substantially violate the adiabaticity condition.

Second we show that, for a generically stable family of\nbundles over a K\\\"ahler manifold, the Petersson-Weil form extends as a closed\npositive current on the whole parameter space of the family. This extension\ntheorem uses classical tools from Yang-Mills theory developed by Donaldson\n(e.g. the Donaldson functional and the heat equation for Hermitian metrics on a\nholomorphic bundle). We apply these results to study families of bundles over a\nK\\\"ahlerian manifold $Y$ parameterized by a non-K\\\"ahlerian surface $X$,\nproving that such families must satisfy very restrictive conditions. These\nresults play an important role in our program to prove existence of curves on\nclass VII surfaces.\n"

The main results of the paper,\nderived from this, are integral formulas for the probability, for given initial\nconfiguration, that the m'th left-most particle is at x at time t. In one of\nthese formulas we can take the limit as N goes to infinity, and it gives the\nprobability for an infinite system where the initial configuration is bounded\non one side.

The extrapolated magnetic field is compared with estimates based upon\nthe synchrotron and inverse Compton emission from three blazars, MKN 501, MKN\n421 and PKS 2155-304. The magnetic fields evaluated from pure synchrotron self-\nCompton models are inconsistent with the magnetic fields extrapolated in this\nway. However, in two cases inverse Compton models in which a substantial part\nof the soft photon field is generated locally agree well, mainly because these\nmodels imply magnetic field strengths which are closer to being consistent with\nPoynting flux dominated jets. This comparison is based on estimating the mass\naccretion rate from the jet energy flux. Further comparisons along these lines\nwill be facilitated by independent estimates of the mass accretion rate in\nblazars and by more detailed models for jet propagation near the black hole.\n"

High helium stars in the numbers proposed\nseem absent from the horizontal branch of Omega Centauri unless their mass loss\nhistory is very different from that of the majority metal-poor stars. It is\npossible to generate a double main sequence with existing Omega Centauri stars\nvia accretion of helium rich pollution consistent with the latest AGB ejecta\ntheoretical yields, and such polluted stars are consistent with the observed HB\nmorphology of Omega Centauri. Polluted models are consistent with observed\nmerging of the main sequences as opposed to our models of helium rich stars.\nUsing the (B-R)/(B+V+R) statistic, we find that the high helium bMS stars\nrequire an age difference compared to the rMS stars that is too great, whereas\nthe pollution scenario stars have no such conflict for inferred Omega Centauri\nmass losses.\n"

    "abstract": "  A complete model of helium-like line and continuum emission has been\nincorporated into the plasma simulation code Cloudy. All elements between He\nand Zn are treated, any number of levels can be considered, and radiative and\ncollisional processes are included. This includes photoionization from all\nlevels, line transfer including continuum pumping and destruction by background\nopacities, scattering, and collisional processes. The model is calculated\nself-consistently along with the ionization and thermal structure of the\nsurrounding nebula. The result is a complete line and continuum spectrum of the\nplasma. Here we focus on the ions of the He I sequence and reconsider the\nstandard helium-like X-ray diagnostics. We first consider semi-analytical\npredictions and compare these with previous work in the low-density,\noptically-thin limit. We then perform numerical calculations of helium-like\nX-ray emission (such as is observed in some regions of Seyferts) and predict\nline ratios as a function of ionizing flux, hydrogen density, and column\ndensity. In particular, we demonstrate that, in photoionized plasmas, the\n$R$-ratio, a density indicator in a collisional plasma, depends on the\nionization fraction and is strongly affected by optical depth for large column\ndensities. We also introduce the notion that the $R$-ratio is a measure of the\nincident continuum at UV wavelengths. The $G$-ratio, which is\ntemperature-sensitive in a collisional plasma, is also discussed, and shown to\nbe strongly affected by continuum pumping and optical depth as well. These\ndistinguish a photoionized plasma from the more commonly studied collisional\ncase.\n"

    "abstract": "  We calculate eclipsing light curves for accretion flows around a rotating\nblack hole taking into account the atmospheric effects of the companion star.\nIn the cases of no atmospheric effects, the light curves contain the\ninformation of the black hole spin because most of the X-ray photons around 1\nkeV usually come from the blueshifted part of the accretion flow near the black\nhole shadow, and the size and the position of the black hole shadow depend on\nthe spin. In these cases, when most of the emission comes from the vicinity of\nthe event horizon, the light curves become asymmetric at ingress and egress. We\nnext investigate the atmospheric absorption and scattering effects of the\ncompanion stars. By using the solar-type atmospheric model, we have taken into\naccount the atmospheric effects of the companion star, such as the\nphotoionization by HI and HeI. We found that the eclipsing light curves\nobserved at 1 keV possibly contain the information of the black hole spin.\nHowever, in our atmospheric model, the effects of the atmosphere are much\nlarger than the effects of the black hole spin. Therefore, even in the case\nthat the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin, it may be\ndifficult to extract the information of the black hole spin if we do not have\nthe realistic atmospheric profiles, such as the temperature, and the number\ndensities for several elements. Even in such cases, the light-curve asymmetries\ndue to the rotation of the accretion disc exist. Only when we have the reliable\natmospheric model, in principle, the information of the strong-gravity regions,\nsuch as the black hole spin, can be obtained from the eclipsing light curves.\n"

    "abstract": "  In this paper, the study of the gravitational collapse of cylindrically\ndistributed two perfect fluid system has been carried out. It is assumed that\nthe collapsing speeds of the two fluids are very large. We explore this\ncondition by using the high-speed approximation scheme. There arise two cases,\ni.e., bounded and vanishing of the ratios of the pressures with densities of\ntwo fluids given by $c_s, d_s$. It is shown that the high-speed approximation\nscheme breaks down by non-zero pressures $p_1, p_2$ when $c_s, d_s$ are bounded\nbelow by some positive constants. The failure of the high-speed approximation\nscheme at some particular time of the gravitational collapse suggests the\nuncertainity on the evolution at and after this time. In the bounded case, the\nnaked singularity formation seems to be impossible for the cylindrical two\nperfect fluids. For the vanishing case, if a linear equation of state is used,\nthe high-speed collapse does not break down by the effects of the pressures and\nconsequently a naked singularity forms. This work provides the generalisation\nof the results already given by Nakao and Morisawa [1] for the perfect fluid.\n"

The proposed mechanism converts trapped ultracold atoms of\ndifferent species into vibrationally excited molecules by a single microwave\ntransition and entirely depends on the existence of a permanent dipole moment\nin the molecules. As opposed to production of molecules by photoassociation or\nmagnetic-field Feshbach resonances our method does not rely on the structure\nand lifetime of excited states or existence of Feshbach resonances. In\naddition, we determine conditions for optimal creation of polar molecules in\nvibrationally excited states of the ground-state potential by changing\nfrequency and intensity of the microwave field. We also explore the possibility\nto produce vibrationally cold molecules by combining the microwave field with\nan optical Raman transition or by applying a microwave field to Feshbach\nmolecules.

Because this maser can be so strong (up\nto thousands of Janskys), it was very helpful during the commissioning phase of\nthe highest frequency band (620-700 GHz) of the Submillimeter Array (SMA)\ninterferometer. From late 2002 to early 2006, brief attempts were made to\nsearch for emission from additional sources beyond the original CSO survey.\nThese efforts have expanded the source count from 10 to 16. The maser emission\nappears to be quite compact spatially, as expected from theoretical\nconsiderations; thus these objects can potentially be used as atmospheric phase\ncalibrators. Many of these objects also exhibit maser emission in the\nvibrationally-excited SiO maser at 215 GHz. Because both maser lines likely\noriginate from a similar physical region, these objects can be used to test\ntechniques of phase transfer calibration between millimeter and submillimeter\nbands. The 658 GHz masers will be important beacons to assess the performance\nof the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in this challenging high-frequency\nband.\n"

    "abstract": "  A transmitter without channel state information (CSI) wishes to send a\ndelay-limited Gaussian source over a slowly fading channel. The source is coded\nin superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description\nin the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the\nchannel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. In the\nlimit of a continuum of infinite layers, the optimal power distribution that\nminimizes the expected distortion is given by the solution to a set of linear\ndifferential equations in terms of the density of the fading distribution. In\nthe optimal power distribution, as SNR increases, the allocation over the\nhigher layers remains unchanged; rather the extra power is allocated towards\nthe lower layers. On the other hand, as the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses per\nsource symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected\ndistortion converges to the power distribution that maximizes expected\ncapacity. While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the\ntransmitter (CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of\nindependent fading paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity\nexceeds that from CSIT, especially when b is large.\n"

This principle leads to the\nenforcement of stress constraints in domains where inelastic deformation would\noccur. During the transition from the continuous structure to the truss-like\none (strut-and-tie model) the dissipation rate is kept constant using the\nprojected gradient method. The equal dissipation rate in the resulting truss\nand in the original continuous structure can be regarded as an equivalence\nstatement and suggests an alternative understanding of physical motivation\nbehind the strut-and-tie modeling.

Based\non the fact that for isotropic materials the elastic trial stress and the\nprojected plastic stress states have the same eigenvec-tors, the loading\nsurface is formulated in the principal stress space rather than using the\ninvariants of stress tensor. The model assumes that the directions of\northotropic damage coincide with principal directions of elastic predictor\nstress state (motivated by coaxial rotated crack model). Due to this\nassumption, the load-ing surface and the closest point projection algorithm can\nstill be formulated in the principal directions. The evolution of the inelastic\nstrain is determined using minimization principle.

This\neliminates the difficulty of a proper definition of equivalent strain which\nserves as a driving force for evolution of damage in concrete. Moreover, if\neigenvectors are known it is not more nec-essary to use invariants of the\nstress tensor for the formulation of loading surface. In the present model the\nloading surface is represented in the polynomial form.

It is surprisingly found that many features that could be thought\nof as ``characteristic'' of a black hole (endowed with an event horizon) can be\nclosely mimicked by a globally static wormhole, having no event horizon. This\nis the case for: the apparently irreversible accretion of matter down a hole,\nno-hair properties, quasi-normal-mode ringing, and even the dissipative\nproperties of black hole horizons, such as a finite surface resistivity equal\nto 377 Ohms. The only way to distinguish the two geometries on an\nobservationally reasonable time scale would be through the detection of\nHawking's radiation, which is, however, too weak to be of practical relevance\nfor astrophysical black holes. We point out the existence of an interesting\nspectrum of quantum microstates trapped in the throat of a wormhole which could\nbe relevant for storing the information ``lost'' during a gravitational\ncollapse.\n"

    "abstract": "  A large symmetry group is perhaps experimentally observed in excited hadrons\nwhich includes the chiral group U(2)_L x U(2)_R as a subgroup. To possess this\nlarge symmetry a dynamical model for excited hadrons, presumably a string\nmodel, should explain formation of chiral multiplets and, at the same time,\npredict coinciding slopes of the angular and radial Regge trajectories. This is\npossible only if both the dynamics of the string and the chirality of the\nquarks at the ends of the string are considered together. We construct a\nmodel-independent unitary transformation from the relativistic chiral basis to\nthe ^{2S+1},L_J basis, commonly used in hadronic phenomenology as well as in the\nstring models, and demonstrate that a hadron belonging to the given chiral\nrepresentation is a fixed superposition of the basis vectors with different L's\nand S's. Thus the description of highly excited hadron in terms of a fixed L is\nnot compatible with chiral symmetry and has to be disregarded in favour of the\ndescription in terms of the total hadron spin J. Therefore, dynamics of the\nstring must deliver the principal quantum number ~n+J, in order chiral\nmultiplets with different spins to become degenerate, as required by the large\nsymmetry group.\n"

    "abstract": "  [Abridged] We present an analysis of the scaling relations between X-ray\nproperties and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) parameters for a sample of 24 X-ray\nluminous galaxy clusters observed with Chandra and with measured SZ effect.\nThese objects are in the redshift range 0.14--0.82 and have X-ray bolometric\nluminosity L>10^45 erg/s. We perform a spatially resolved spectral analysis and\nrecover the density, temperature and pressure profiles of the ICM, just relying\non the spherical symmetry of the cluster and the hydrostatic equilibrium\nhypothesis. We observe that the correlations among X-ray quantities only are in\nagreement with previous results obtained for samples of high-z X-ray luminous\ngalaxy clusters. On the relations involving SZ quantities, we obtain that they\ncorrelate with the gas temperature with a logarithmic slope significantly\nlarger than the predicted value from the self-similar model. The measured\nscatter indicates, however, that the central Compton parameter y_0 is a proxy\nof the gas temperature at the same level of other X-ray quantities like\nluminosity. Our results on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations show a tension\nbetween the quantities more related to the global energy of the system (e.g.\ngas temperature, gravitating mass) and the indicators of the structure of the\nICM (e.g. gas density profile, central Compton parameter y_0), showing the most\nsignificant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from the\nself-similar model in the L-T, L-M_{tot},, M_{gas},-T, y_0-T relations. When the\nslope is fixed to the self-similar value, these relations consistently show a\nnegative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the ICM at higher redshift\nhas lower both X-ray luminosity and pressure in the central regions than the\nexpectations from self-similar model.\n"

In the case of LFV the sneutrino mass eigenstates\nhave no definite flavour, therefore, in the t-channel more than one sneutrino\nmass eigenstate can contribute to the chargino production cross sections. Our\nframework is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) including LFV\nterms. We show that in spite of the restrictions on the LFV parameters due to\nthe current limits on rare lepton decays, the cross section \\sigma(e+e- -->\n\\chi+_1 \\chi-_1) can change by a factor of 2 or more when varying the LFV\nmixing angles.

We study at\nunprecedented resolution (0.34\" across the jet axis) the properties of the\ninnermost SiO ``microjet'' within 1000 AU of this young Class 0 source, to\ncompare it with atomic microjets from more evolved sources and to constrain its\norigin. The SiO channel maps are used to investigate the microjet collimation\nand velocity structure. A large velocity gradient analysis is applied to SiO\n(2-1), (5-4) and (8-7) data from the PdBI and the Submillimeter Array to\nconstrain the SiO opacity and abundance. The HH212 Class 0 microjet shows\nstriking similarities in collimation and energetic budget with atomic microjets\nfrom T Tauri sources. Furthermore, the SiO lines appear optically thick, unlike\nwhat is generally assumed. We infer T(kin) ~ 50-500 K and an SiO/H2 abundance\ngreater than 4 10(-8)-6 10(-5) for n(H2) = 10(7)-10(5) cm(-3), i.e. 0.05-90% of\nthe elemental silicon. This similar jet width, regardless of the presence of a\ndense envelope, definitely rules out jet collimation by external pressure, and\nfavors a common MHD self-collimation (and possibly acceleration) process at all\nstages of star formation. We propose that the more abundant SiO in Class 0 jets\ncould mainly result from rapid (less than 25 yrs) molecular synthesis at high\njet densities.\n"

    "abstract": "  We discuss mechanisms of self-organization processes in two-level solid-state\nclass-B laser system. The model is considered under assumptions of influence of\nnonlinear absorber and external force, separately. It was found that\nself-organization occurs through the Hopf bifurcation and results to a stable\npulse radiation. Analysis is performed according to the Floquet exponent\ninvestigation. It was found that influence of the nonlinear absorber extends\nthe domain of control parameters that manage a stable periodic radiation\nprocesses. An external force suppresses self-organization processes. A combined\ninfluence of both external force and nonlinear absorber results to more\ncomplicated picture of self-organization with two reentrant Hopf bifurcations.\n"

    "title": "Mass loss from Luminous Blue Variables and Quasi-Periodic Modulations of\n  Radio Supernovae",
    "abstract": "  Massive stars, supernovae (SNe), and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\nhave a huge impact on their environment. Despite their importance, a\ncomprehensive knowledge of which massive stars produce which SN/GRB is hitherto\nlacking. We present a brief overview about our knowledge of mass loss in the\nHertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) covering evolutionary phases of the OB main\nsequence, the unstable Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage, and the Wolf-Rayet\n(WR) phase. Despite the fact that metals produced by ``self-enrichment'' in WR\natmospheres exceed the initial -- host galaxy -- metallicity, by orders of\nmagnitude, a particularly strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on the\ninitial metallicity is found for WR stars at sub-solar metallicities (1/10 --\n1/100 solar). This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model for\nGRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular\nmomentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds\nmay inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities. Furthermore, we discuss\nrecently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe\n2001ig and 2003bg. We show that both the sinusoidal behaviour and the\nrecurrence timescale of these modulations are consistent with the predicted\nmass-loss behaviour of LBVs, and we suggest LBVs may be the progenitors of some\ncore-collapse SNe.\n"

    "title": "Constraining GRB progenitor models by probing Wolf-Rayet wind geometries\n  in the Large Magellanic Cloud",
    "abstract": "  The favoured progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are rapidly\nrotating Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. However, most Galactic WR stars are slow\nrotators, as stellar winds are thought to remove angular momentum. This poses a\nchallenge to the collapsar model. Recent observations indicate that GRBs occur\npredominately in low metallicity (Z) environments, which may resolve the\nproblem: lower Z leads to less mass loss, which may inhibit angular momentum\nremoval, allowing WR stars to remain rotating rapidly until collapse. We wish\nto determine whether low Z WR stars rotate on average more rapidly than\nGalactic WR stars, and perform a Very Large Telescope (VLT) linear\nspectropolarimetry survey of WR stars in the low Z environment of the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) and compare our results with the Galactic sample. We\nfind that only 2 out of 13 (i.e. 15%) of LMC WR stars show line polarization\neffects, compared to a similarly low fraction of ~15-20% for Galactic WR stars.\nThe low incidence of line polarization effects in LMC WR stars suggests that\nthe threshold metallicity where significant differences in WR rotational\nproperties occur is below that of the LMC (Z ~ 0.5 Zsun), possibly constraining\nGRB progenitor channels to this upper metallicity.\n"

    "abstract": "  The growth of atomically-flat thin films of ferroelectric PbTiO3 on SrTiO3\nsubstrates, using molecular beam epitaxy, is reported. The main issue in the\ngrowth of these materials is the high volatility of lead. This can be largely\novercome by using PbO, instead of Pb, as a source and by using atomic oxygen\nduring growth. The continuous decrease of the out-of-plane lattice parameter\nwith increasing temperature in the investigated range, indicates that PbTiO3 is\nstill ferroelectric at the growth temperature (Tg= 600oC), which agrees with\nthe theoretical prediction of TC= 765oC (compared to TCbulk= 490oC) for the\npresent mismatch strain values.\n"
